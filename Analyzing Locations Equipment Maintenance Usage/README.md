## Software


- Microsoft Power BI
- Microsoft SQL Server Microsoft SQL Server 2016 13.0.5108.50


## Purpose
I was tasked to analyze the purchase order spending among the 140+ locations to identify the following:

1. Trends in spending over time for each location.
2. Identify locations with the highest and lowest spending trends.
3. Identify equipment parts contributing most to spending costs.


# Process Overview

I connected Power BI to the company's Microsoft SQL server to query purchase order data. A dashboard was created to chart spend by location over time using the following parameters as filters:
- Equipment part number
- Location
- Year
- PO status code
