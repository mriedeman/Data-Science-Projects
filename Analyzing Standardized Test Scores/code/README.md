## Structure of Jupyter Notebooks for this Project

This folder is comprised of three notebooks used to analyze ACT, SAT, and College Attendance data. Each notebook represents a different portion of the data, but the dataframes are combined in the "College_Freshman_Attendance_2018.ipynb" file. This is the file is where final conlusions and recommendations are made, but there are also conclusions and recommendations for the individual SAT and ACT data in their respective notebooks.
