"This game has been super frustrating, but seriously people, it‚Äôs not like we are last place and can‚Äôt ever score runs. 

Yeah, the leaving RISP tonight has been for shit. 

But seriously chill with ‚Äúnot deserving‚Äù to be where they are or ‚Äúthis team is shit‚Äù. 

They have worked their asses off and are down by a run and literally 2 nights ago came back to win. It could still happen. If not, there‚Äôs tomorrow.",Giants
"Nervous about this series, I'd be incredibly happy if we take 1. Dodgers are up and down this week but the house of horrors with that douchebag Bauer on the mound..let's get it.",Giants

Is the dodger stadium sound system run by 13 year olds?,Giants
I hate how irrationally angry I get whenever I see the Giants not play well.,Giants

#B",Giants

"TIL that *Woodbridge by Mondavi* is the official wine of the Dodgers.

Woodbridge is a real town, and it's where the wine is made. It's right next to Lodi. It's Giants territory.

The irony is kind of delicious.",Giants
Giants gonna win this game,Giants
"Holy shit, Gabe‚Äôs shoes lol",Giants
"Lamonte Wade just oozes big leaguer, legit big leaguer

Duggar reaching that territory 

Good times in Giants Outfield land baby

That storm off the mound by Bauer only to be stopped by an umpire for a substance check is absolute perfect timing,Giants
"#OH LOOK, THEY'RE DOING THE WAVE
#ISN'T THAT CUTE
#FUCKING DODGER FANS",Giants
God I hate Hernandez. That's two at bats stolen,Giants
Couldn‚Äôt be a worse umpire matchup for us. We are a team that doesn‚Äôt like to swing and miss.,Giants
the dodgers haven't received any of the bs that we've had to deal with,Giants
the wave makes their fanbase look like tools,Giants
"Flem's deadpan ""hooray"" about the wave giving me life right now. üòÇ",Giants

444 ft HR is the longest for Crawford ever,Giants
"Yaz needs to get real sexy rn, I'm getting a little tired of popouts",Giants
Jon Miller has NO FUCKS left! my hero,Giants
"Going for 2nd was the right move 9 times out of 10, it just took a terrible bounce. I don‚Äôt get all the criticism for the decision

Edit: as is, it was still an extremely close play",Giants
I'm going. Fuk yes.,Giants
Only 7 more hours to go boys and girls! Fuck the Dodgers.,Giants
Angel Hernandez already on his bullshit,Giants
he just took the bat out of his hands. that's not fair.,Giants
That‚Äôs a polite way of saying he‚Äôs a garbage ump,Giants
When the Dodgers and Giants fans agree on something you know it's an atrocious call,Giants
"Just tuned in. Hernandez is behind the plate? Aww, fuck",Giants
Flem despises angel Hernandez,Giants
"Also fuck Angel Hern√°ndez for that bullshit racial discrimination lawsuit that was a slap in the face to actual racism victims.

Incompetent piece of shit.",Giants
2 runs ain‚Äôt no thang. Tony Disco will settle in.,Giants
going out on a limb here and gonna say that kruk isn't an angel hernandez fan,Giants
This guy is not playing like someone who wants to be called T-Bone,Giants
That was certainly an at bat.,Giants
"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing malicious about what Yastrzemski did‚Äù correct, there‚Äôs a lot that‚Äôs heroic about it",Giants
It's looking like one of those games were gonna get runners on base every inning and go 0-20 with risp,Giants
We are winning this game.,Giants
Bauer has danced out of trouble several times and has 100 pitches thru 6 but he acts like he just won game 7. There‚Äôs celebrating then there‚Äôs looking like a complete clown in a mid-season game in the 6th inning.,Giants
Leave Garcia in plz. He acting real cute rn,Giants
This is the most frustrating game I‚Äôve watched in a long time.,Giants
This thread has more comments before the game starts than every D-backs thread will have this week combined,Giants
Why is this game so late damnit I need to wait another 75 minutes,Giants
Wow wtf...so the zone is a horizontal rectangle tonight?,Giants
Robot umps please,Giants
alright you better be calling those for the dodgers too then,Giants
Blows a call immediately and lets Mookie get ahead in the count. Angel Hernandez needs to be banned from the sport.,Giants
Bauer kinda looks like an owl with its head upside down,Giants
"Tunes in to watch the Giants game

*Sees who the home plate ump is*

Alright guys see you tomorrow, I don‚Äôt need that aggravation in my life",Giants
"Mets fan tuning in....

Did your broadcast just say ""shitburger"" on air?",Giants
Every single Padres/Dodgers game thread is them desperate for us to 'regress'. Now apparently its going to happen after the all star break,Giants
Disco 3 run bomb incoming,Giants
Bauer looks like he's remembering a lot of past trauma every time he walks off the mound.,Giants
Disco has given up 15 runs against the Dodgers in 11 innings. He‚Äôs given up 15 runs against every other team he‚Äôs faced in 80 innings.,Giants
Angel Hernandez should be unemployed,Giants

0-13 with RISP. Ridiculous.,Giants
"0 for 13 

It is truly hard to get more SF than that",Giants
"Neutral eyes here, he absolutely looked safe.",Giants
Max Muncy is best friends with Trevor Bauer but Trevor Bauer is best friends with someone else.,Giants
"One time I went to a dodgers-giants game I think in 2018 or something. I walked past a guy who had a dodgers world series letterman jacket. I said to him ""Hey man that's an old jacket! WHEW that OLD!"" While smiling and giving him a thumbs up. He didn't really get it at first and sort of smiled and awkwardly tipped his head up at me. 

I walked away about maybe 100 feet or so and I could hear him shout back ""HEY FUCK YOU"" hahaha",Giants
"Another day, another Ohtani ball crushed. More and more, I‚Äôm impressed with the Giants gameplan and execution against him.",Giants
Angel Hernandez is so fucking trash. The fact he has a job is shameful. The umpire‚Äôs union is disgusting.,Giants
Fuck you Angel. I blame you for that bs,Giants
I know he‚Äôs a pitcher but fuck that‚Äôs an annoying at bat. He‚Äôd thrown 5 straight balls and you swing at 2 more balls and then take strike 3.,Giants
Just wanna say how great it is to see so many people joining the Wade Jr flair train.,Giants
Trying to pull a Tauchman... you‚Äôre not that guy pal,Giants
"50 pitches for Bauer and a 1 run game, nice inning",Giants
i hate muncy so much,Giants
Yaz needs to step up. He‚Äôs been cold lately.,Giants
fuck the dodgers and fuck this ump,Giants
Arrest Angel Hernandez IMMEDIATELY,Giants
"I genuinely wonder what, if any, thought process Hernandez has for calling pitches. Is it based on some kind of vague feeling? Is he just like ‚Äú1, 2, 3, WILD CARD?!‚Äù",Giants
So was Angel named in jest? Cause he is clearly an agent of Satan.,Giants
God I cannot believe he still has turn down for what as his walk up music that is so unbelievably embarrassing,Giants
"Its a struggle to watch the games when the bats are cold..but much much worse with this ump, what an inconsistent piece of trash.",Giants
"Flemming's fukken cracking me up. At least there's that.

""Wouldn't be a Dodger game without beach balls and The Wave. Hooray.""",Giants

I love Jon Miller",Giants
"John on the radio. Audios Pelo.... I beg your pardon, I got over excited",Giants
RISP... our only weakness,Giants
You can‚Äôt even protect against this zone. It‚Äôs so fucking bad.,Giants
Trevor Bauer has to use Spider Tack to keep the condom from falling off,Giants
"Lol, give up a home run and get bailed out by the umpire - celebrate like those things didn't happen. It's like a rich kid that celebrates his parents buying him a BMW like he bought it himself",Giants
I‚Äôve been completely wrong on Jarlin. Dude has been nails lately,Giants
How the fuck is angel hernandez still an umpire,Giants
Yaz can have my shins,Giants
"Unfortunate. This happens when 2 good teams play though. They hit corners, low scoring bs. Just need one real clutch hit",Giants
"Might be unpopular, but I like the move to put Tauchman in the game (even if that was the only choice to fill in for Yaz) he's already personally fucked the Dodgers once, and I feel like he may be on the verge of a bat Renaissance.",Giants
"*""The curious strike zone of Angel Hernandez""*

"The ""Beat SF"" is the most awkward chant of all time",Giants
"Dave Flemming: ""You certainly can't trust the umpire""",Giants
Why the hell was Casali the PH?,Giants
"Unpopular opinion: Disco didn‚Äôt actually do too badly, this evening. Three bad pitches are the difference.",Giants
"Okay I know we‚Äôre all mad about the offense but damn: 

Leone is dealing right now.",Giants
Only good thing about this game is how much Flem hates Angel,Giants
We beat ourselves just as bad as New York and Angel did with just stranding everyone. Poor Flores.,Giants
"You know, can't be mad about what happened in the 9th when they leave 13 stranded in scoring position",Giants
oh thank god. i‚Äôve been awake since 11pm. i have been so effing bored. now i have ktvu and gameday thread!,Giants
Just saw our run diff is at +100 now...hnnnnng,Giants
"Apparently we just had a 4.1 quake in the ~~Beast~~ East Bay. And, I felt nothing.",Giants
Angel fucking sucks. This is about to be a long game,Giants
**FUCK ANGEL HERNANDEZ**,Giants
You'd think MLB would want to hide these zombies in high visibility games,Giants
And Angel thinks he should be a crew chief. His understanding of competence is the only thing worse than his understanding of the strikezone.,Giants
Angel ‚ÄúWhat Is A Strikezone‚Äù Hernandez,Giants
If Angel Hern√°ndez and CB Bucknor were drowning and you only had time to save one what kind of sandwich would you make?,Giants
so that's a ball but the pitch to posey is a strike?,Giants
Fuck this game already. Angel Hernandez is a fucking chump. I‚Äôve seen better eyes on a goddamn potato,Giants
i fucking hate the dodgers,Giants
Why throw that over the plate? It‚Äôs 1-2.,Giants
√Ångel Hern√°ndez making his presence felt immediately.,Giants
"Only 2 runs and Disco worked past it with only 15 pitches. Still very much anyone's game, let's light up Bauer pls",Giants
I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs a bad chase consider Hernandez has a mile wide zone,Giants
"In all fairness, Hernandez might‚Äôve called it a strike, anyway.",Giants
We‚Äôre getting on base at least. A good sign.,Giants
this is your daily reminder that we won the shaun anderson trade,Giants
Why do I hate the dodgers so fucking much,Giants
Walking guys against the Dodgers is a recipe for disaster,Giants
"bunt, you fools",Giants
Trevor Bauer mouth breather,Giants
"#I HATE THE DODGERS
#WHO IS WITH ME",Giants
"Look, I never ever say anything about umpires and pitches. But no doubt that Bauer is getting strikes we are not. Annoying ass game. 3 hits for LA yet they lead 3-1. You cant win games scoring 1 run on the road. Offense needs to pick it up.",Giants
Disco‚Äôs command has been pretty terrible today,Giants
The entire Giants radio/tv team is DONE with Angel.,Giants
"Just doesn‚Äôt feel like the giants night. Shitty ump, bad hitting luck, etc",Giants
Terrible inning. Fuck you Hernandez. You fucking suck.,Giants
Max Muncy does 55 in the left lane.,Giants
Does it make it better or worse that Hernandez has the weakest strike motion in the game? He just kinda throws his hand up like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fucking know. Strike?‚Äù,Giants
Runner at second with no outs and he doesn‚Äôt even make it to third. What a fucking shameful display of situational baseball.,Giants
Bauer looks like an idiot doing that move. Fuck LA,Giants
I hope I never have to see this moron Bauer in a Giants uniform,Giants
"Bauer has literally gotten every pitch near the zone tonight (and a couple way off the zone), I‚Äôve never seen anything like this before",Giants
"Kruk: Left him standing up there like a pair of shoes.  

Omg LMFAO Krukow is a total gem, we are so lucky",Giants
"Dave is ripping Hernandez right now, as if the bad calls aren't ""enough to shake your confidence"" the hit by pitch foul was.",Giants
can tauchman pull a tauchman tonight?,Giants
"""Curious strike zone"" is putting it mildly, Greg.",Giants
Angelllllll give me the name of your dealer I just wanna know what you‚Äôre onnnnn,Giants
98 in the dirt surprised Hernandez didn‚Äôt think that was a strike,Giants
Casali should not have been anywhere near that pinch hit AB,Giants
this game should be like 5-3,Giants
0-13 is the most ABs without a hit with RISP this year in an NL game,Giants
Disgusting how much I like mookie. Why did he have to join the douchiest bunch of fucking pricks in sports?,Giants
it just *had* to be vs the Dodgers where we pull this 0-13 RISP bullshit,Giants
What better way to end it than with a shit at bat from Dickerson,Giants
"That is brutal, horrid, demoralizing loss. 0 for fucking 13.",Giants
"I'll say this, Kershaw looked impressive yesterday. He *pitches* now. Gets people out with off speed stuff like Lincecum had to do. He can't paint the corners with 94 for strike 3 anymore.",Giants
Trevor Bauer practices his sword-sheathing move in front of the mirror at home.,Giants
Trevor Bauer is a flat-earther.,Giants
Trevor Bauer is so absurd and such a jackass that at least five of the jokes we‚Äôve made so far are actually true,Giants
Bauer is a sub and the sword sheathing is his dom‚Äôs go to move. He calls himself ‚Äúthe scabbard.‚Äù,Giants
yo fuck Angel Hernandez,Giants
Krukow pissed at Hernandez lmao,Giants
i get why he had to throw that pitch. he can't get calls.,Giants
This ump is going to make me not want to watch this game,Giants
K optimism time. Giving up 2 runs on 2 hits and 7 pitches is waaay better than 2 runs on like 4 hits and 30 pitches. Disco can still settle in,Giants
"Not going to say this game is over yet, but the Giants had better bring their offense tonight.",Giants
"Welp, 8 more innings left. LET'S GO G-MEN!!!",Giants
i'm more upset about this zone than the actual score,Giants
"26 pitches through the 2nd inning. That's pretty damn good. Now, if we can word on Bauer's pitchcount and knock him out of the game, the plan will come together.",Giants
Disco has settled down. Now the offense needs to get going,Giants
Did the Dodgers think they'd get Posey out twice in a row? That's not allowed morons,Giants
We cut into the lead. There‚Äôs a lot of game left.,Giants
That‚Äôs not a strike,Giants
"Sorry guys, we hadn‚Äôt given up a hit since the first, then I went to the bathroom and they hit a HR while I was in there. I‚Äôll take responsibility and I won‚Äôt leave the living room while the ball is in play.",Giants
I feel like we‚Äôre gonna get some runs here,Giants
#LWJ is Bauer‚Äôs kryptonite,Giants
What the fuck Hernandez,Giants
Angel Hernandez is a blind son of a bitch. Can we PLEASE see Kapler blow up on this incompetent fuck?,Giants
can we start a petition to get Angel Hernandez thrown out of the league?,Giants
"A bad zone is one thing but literally all the calls have gone to the same team tonight, what the fuck are our hitters even supposed to do",Giants
"I'd just like to remind everyone that MLB released a public statement that Angel Hernandez doesn't get to call playoff games because he's a terrible umpire. 


And they still employ him.",Giants
"Of all the recent Giants killers, Muncy hurts the most. At least Goldschmidt and Arenado look physically fit",Giants
Should be a K. Fuck you Angel,Giants
Angel Hernandez should be executed change my mind,Giants
"Flemming: wouldn't be LA without beach balls and the wave

Also Flem: hooray :/",Giants
"crawford says ""i hate the dodgers""",Giants
I like grumpy Dave Roberts.,Giants
"Let this sink in, Brandon Crawford is on pace for 35+ homers this season",Giants
Good swing - that would‚Äôve been called a strike,Giants
Jesus christ Ruf.  Took yourself out of that ab.  Got one back.,Giants
god Bauer is annoying as hell,Giants
You celebrate over that? Umm okay?,Giants
FUCK OFF BAUER,Giants
"Imagine slandering your employer, suing them after, then still having a job after. Angel Hernandez has it made!",Giants
If we tie it up here we can at the very least get Bauer a no decision which would be highly enjoyable,Giants
Tauchman about to beat angels ass üòÇ,Giants
Kap‚Äôs shoes are üî•,Giants
"1.	FTD
2.	fuck Angel Hernandez
3.	Fuck the Dodgers",Giants
"I feel like one of the really fun things the All Star Game could do this year is that everyone who wins the vote or gets selected on a roster brings pitchforks and torches and mobs Coors Field until Bucknor, Angel Hern√°ndez, and Manfred are driven out of baseball. In their home team uniforms too.",Giants
Dickersons swings look horrendous,Giants
God we need one of our outfielders not named Duggar to get hot,Giants
We desperately need a spark from one of our batters outside the usual guys who do all the hitting for us,Giants
‚ÄúOh fuck oh no not this guy‚Äù -the Dodgers when Tauchman enters,Giants
Nobody has ever needed an all star break more than Yaz,Giants
This is shaping up to be the most frustrating game yet,Giants
"good pitching from sherfy aside, this game has been incredibly frustrating. we've honestly looked like the better team but moral victories don't win baseball games.",Giants
Angel hernandez is such a bitch. Fuck you man,Giants
Hot take: Angel Hernandez is bad,Giants
What a fuckin save to the backstop,Giants
Muncy is literally a fat neckbeard. I can smell him from the TV.,Giants
0-13 with RISP,Giants
we deserve the loss,Giants
"Well we have no excuse other than just being dog shit in the clutch tonight 0-13 with runners in scoring position, most of them pitiful ABs",Giants
i know slater and dubon have both been bad but casali was not the move,Giants
"Posey has to hit a solo shot, since he's bookended by corpses",Giants
A loss today isn‚Äôt the end of the world but man it‚Äôs just so frustrating because we‚Äôve had every single chance to take this one while they‚Äôre struggling to string together hits. This was such a great opportunity to build our division lead and get some momentum,Giants
I‚Äôm not even scared of Jansen. We‚Äôve boned him in the past.,Giants
Well bullpen was a huge positive tonight,Giants
Angel was probably gonna call that a ball til posey gave himself up,Giants
Completely embarrassed ourselves tonight. Gotta hope Yaz is ok and we haven‚Äôt lost the clutch gene. I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt say this game makes me nervous.,Giants
"So where would y'all put the Naylor leg injury? I'd put it up there Posey and Livingston for most painful leg injuries to watch, personally.",Giants
"Oh man Dylan Bundy just blew chunks all over the infield at Yankee Stadium, in full view of the cameras...",Giants
"Bauer has begun his pregame ritual

[Here's a live look in](https://giphy.com/gifs/jeAHzKVKDqzhS)",Giants
"Checking in from enemy territory. No direct threats of violence yet, but that may have to do with my seats. 

Lower level on the third base path, maybe 25 rows from the field staring straight at home plate. Cost is roughly what decent third deck seats cost at Oracle.

I‚Äôll talk shit on the team all day, but dodger stadium is so fantastically huge. Crap garlic fries though.",Giants
Angel Hernandez is behind the dish tonight. üòí,Giants
"take some pitches, giants!",Giants
Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!! Beat LA!!!!!,Giants
we're not getting no-hit and in that i consider this a victory,Giants

"I‚Äôve never hated an umpire more than Angel Hernandez. I dislike Joe West, but I actually have some respect for him simply for how long he‚Äôs been in the sport and for his cameo in *The Naked Gun.* Hernandez hasn‚Äôt said or done anything that made me like him remotely.",Giants
In fairness that last pitch was one he had to protect,Giants
Bauer upset with a clear ball,Giants
ball 3 and ball 4 were strike 3 on buster lmao,Giants
We looked pretty helpless against sticky Bauer in May. Today seems better,Giants

Want an out? Hit it to Crawford!,Giants
Good bounce back inning for Disco/T-Bone! Now let's walk a ton and score some goddamn runs.,Giants
Will angel Hernandez sue me too if I call him a fucking joke?,Giants
Dude how good has wade been for us,Giants
LWJ THE GOAT,Giants
LAMONTE WADE JR IS AN EVERYDAY PLAYER.,Giants
Reminder that we fucking sent Wade down before Belt got hurt,Giants
"LAMONTE WADE JR üòçüß°üß°

You wild home run man/stallion",Giants
LOL not everyone can be Mike Tauchman!,Giants
#SEND LAGOAT DOWN AGAIN. DOUBLE DOG DARE YOU.,Giants
Wade is a major leaguer dammit.,Giants
Proud to rock my flair,Giants
Bauer is in pain,Giants
You just can‚Äôt leave a fastball down the middle to Buster Posey.,Giants
Amazing piece of hitting from Posey,Giants
Buster flicks doubles like light switches,Giants
"Nothing you can do Dick, that pitch was fucking filthy",Giants
I wonder if Lamont Wade Sr. is available to be signed?,Giants
Angel Hernandez doesn‚Äôt even have a good strike 3 motion,Giants
I don‚Äôt like Max Muncy,Giants
Can‚Äôt walk guys,Giants
"#And now a word from 3-time Gold Glove award-winning Forever Giant Brandon Crawford
https://i.imgur.com/RsuPyaj.jpg",Giants
Max Muncy doesn‚Äôt like Sprite because it‚Äôs *too spicy*,Giants
Geez LA looking like Mordor in that wide shot,Giants
i guess it's going to be one of *those* games with risp?,Giants
"Not gonna lie, Bauer is looking a little shook. Lost that swagger. And I like it.",Giants
Bauer looks like a guy literally every single one of us got in a fight with in high school.,Giants
Hes throwing the fucking worst 2-strike pitches.,Giants
That one was definitely on Disco. Hanging slider. Yikes.,Giants
At least they‚Äôre all solo HR. We‚Äôre still in this.,Giants
Trevor Bauer strictly goes to Smart n Final for groceries.,Giants
Wade was so casual there,Giants
"Fucking troll in our sub.
u/Calibears_2016 or some shit.",Giants
Hey Yaz...don't strike out?,Giants
What the fuck,Giants
Fuck you Angel,Giants
that hasn't been called all night,Giants
"My goodness, angel. Fuck off forever and retire, you stupid ass martyr",Giants
Dude someone is going to explode on Hernandez,Giants
Imagine if you were as bad at your job as Angel Hernandez is at his,Giants
Good job backing that up Yaz,Giants
Max Muncy showers before he takes a shit never after.,Giants
BEAT LA!!!!!!ü§¨,Giants
i fuckin hate Muncy. i think he‚Äôs my most hated dodger of all time. it‚Äôs either him Gagne or Lo Duca,Giants
"Hi Giants fans, I'm visiting from r/whitesox and I admire your team. 

I have a dumb question: did Don Miller stop announcing tonight at some point? I listened to him all through the 90s when I grew up in Maryland
 He's one of my all time faves.",Giants
"""Hooray.""",Giants
#Wave at that double play ya Bums!,Giants
Given Crawford‚Äôs childhood love of the Giants it always feels extra special when he fucks the Dodgers :))),Giants
35 mil a year for a mid-rotation starter lmao,Giants
Bro I hate watching Bauer waddle his chunky ass around the diamond,Giants
"they have to cash in on risp sometime, right?",Giants
Leprechauns are evil.,Giants
Two incredibly un-clutch at bats from Duggar and Solano. Brutal.,Giants
Ruf 2/17 pinch hitting isn‚Äôt exactly the stat I‚Äôm looking for lol,Giants
Somebody give Angel a refresher on where the zone is,Giants
"#POSITIVITY

Bauer's about to 100 pitches.",Giants
Celebrating his 98th pitch in the 6th inning. Way to be Bauer.,Giants
So glad Kike Hernandez is no longer playing for LA. Dude always mashed against us. Dude could be hitting .100 and go 6/8 in a series against us with like 3 homers and 5 RBI.,Giants
FIRE ANGEL HERNANDEZ,Giants
"This game is a sham; win, lose, what the fuck ever. But Yaz, please be okay.",Giants
"Yaz at bats have been really hard to watch recently. Hope he figures it out soon, as there are no other options",Giants
"Alright, Craw, want to make it a two-homer game? Because that‚Äôs what I want for you",Giants
Dickerson has done nothing to earn big league playing time this year. I‚Äôm sick of watching him hit,Giants
I'm over Dickerson,Giants
Ugh that was uncharacteristically poor bat control from Craw.,Giants
We literally cannot do ANYTHING with RISP it just feels like there's no hope even if its 0 outs every time,Giants
"Dickerson‚Äôs OBP is *.300*, which isn‚Äôt even much better than Tauchman‚Äôs (.282). There‚Äôs absolutely zero reason he should be starting at this point, if he can‚Äôt give us decent hitting then he‚Äôs bringing no value to the team",Giants
This win tonight won‚Äôt be as dramatic without these frustrations at the plate.  Cmon! These are the giants.  They never make it look easy‚Ä¶,Giants
What are dodger fans booing? It‚Äôs baseball...,Giants
Change my view: giants have actually played this game better overall so far,Giants
hockey goaltender or gawky holetender ü§î,Giants
Well productive out at least,Giants
Embarrassing,Giants
Dodgers have had 1 fucking opportunity with RISP (0-1) and they are winning because of our BS,Giants
We are somehow outplaying the Dodgers while also playing complete shit.,Giants
Just now checking in on this game and I saw Angel Hernandez trending on twitter. That bad?,Giants
Crazy it should be like 8-3 Giants right now.,Giants
The Casali PH had to be gut versus analytics,Giants
Don‚Äôt worry our .172-hitting secret weapon is coming up.,Giants
"In defense of the Casali decision in the last inning, he has been hitting .429 over the past 14 days. Slater is hitting .143, and Dubon is .200 in 7, (.292 in 14 but that is mostly against LHP.)

Also, if the 1B ump gives him a favorable swing call, that‚Äôs a 2-1 count and he‚Äôs in control. Having 2 strikes against Treinen is nearly impossible.",Giants
Just find a way to get on Tauchman,Giants
Holy shit dude avoided the tag.,Giants
I haven't been this angry at a game in a long time,Giants
One of the worst at bats I‚Äôve ever seen Buster take,Giants
this is by far the most frustrating game of the year in my opinion. I'm fucking livid.,Giants
"This game has done nothing but piss me off. Fuck all of this. Figure it out, offense",Giants
Tauchman should have known we are allergic to RISP anyway and stayed at 1st,Giants
What an absolute shitshow of a game.,Giants
"Fireworks!?? 

 What the fuck that‚Äôs fucked up",Giants
Pants on and fuck LA and Angel goddamn Hernandez,Giants
we could‚Äôve won. they didn‚Äôt want to bunt. simple.,Giants
I really wanted to see a HR when those fireworks started going off,Giants
Dodger cunts won on only 5 hits. Fuck them.,Giants
I really like Tauchman but man his bat is dragging us down these days,Giants
# FUCK THE DODGERS,Giants
Every strikeout t-bone gets I will take a shot,Giants
For fuck sake,Giants
Good lord Angel Hernandez.,Giants
Fucking Angel mother fucking Hernandez. How is this dipshit still calling games?,Giants
Well that wasn't a strike,Giants
Angel hernandez is a trash ass umpire,Giants
Probably the widest strike I've ever seen,Giants
Why does it seem like every single ump is calling strikes a foot outside the zone,Giants
"You don't see Buster Posey complain about calls...

You know it's serious when Posey complains...",Giants
"Angel Hernandez just needs to fucking retire already. His son is already a minor league ump, we cant have two at the same time",Giants
Alright shake it off Disco,Giants
OMG WE MUST CRUSH THEM TONIGHT,Giants
Fuck i hate this game already. What is up with disco against the Dodgers?,Giants
I‚Äôm gonna need to dip out for a while before I become furious and break something I need,Giants

Stay hot Flores!,Giants
"fuck turner

dude looks like a troll doll",Giants
Lmao Flemming just shitting on angel,Giants
Why is Duggar batting 7th? He's earned his spot to move up in the lineup I feel like,Giants
Duggar has spoiled me with so many hits I feel extra disappointed when he doesn‚Äôt get on,Giants
"‚ÄúTrevor, you dog you‚Äù

This broadcast just got more steamy.",Giants
Well at least we got Disco to the plate,Giants
"I really feel like he is tipping his pitches or they just have a good report on him, they don‚Äôt really look fooled at all.",Giants
BUSTER POSEY GOT FUCKED,Giants
Dodgers score two runs and yet the Giants are the only team through the order‚Ä¶small victories?,Giants
I‚Äôll have a leadoff baserunner please,Giants

I‚Äôve been on the Wade train since day 1 and I‚Äôm so glad he keeps rolling,Giants

But man, 90% of them really feel like solo home runs",Giants

Hey Dick can you go on one of your batting tears and raise your BA like 50 points this series thx,Giants
We got a game here. Keep it up T-bone!,Giants
Wade needs to be a regular in this lineup,Giants
"At least CB Bucknor‚Äôs strike three call is kind of entertaining, √Ångel Hern√°ndez is about as cool as Randall Weems from Recess.",Giants
"I think Wade has earned the right to see time against left-handed pitchers. I get that he literally doesn't have a hit against one, but c'mon.",Giants
Statement inning from Disco incoming since he has to face Betts and Muncy again,Giants
lol Bot giving us Cleveland updates in the highlights now.,Giants
"Fuck it. When Belt gets back, Wade takes Dick‚Äôs fielding position AND batting order position. Daddy Wade in cleanup",Giants
good news: we didn't give up a hit to the pitcher,Giants
Fuck mid inning ads.,Giants
Mookie stinks,Giants
"this is ridiculous

if you're going to use balls six inches outside of the zone to strike out posey, then any one of those balls should've struck out mookie too",Giants
They still letting Toyota run ads in SF after the last couple days? Oof,Giants
"Not gonna lie, I dig the flat bill look on Wade. Giving us the Vizquel look.",Giants
"Has anyone actually had a Dodger Dog? Are they any good? All the Dodgers fans I know won‚Äôt shut the hell up about them.

We were at Costco and Dodger dogs are apparently better than paying $1.50 for a soda and a foot long hot dog. I gotta hard time believing there‚Äôs much better than that",Giants
SIT DOWN,Giants
Sit down you inbred fuck,Giants
"Muncy wanted a HR way too badly lmao, he never chases that much",Giants
Justin Turner fought as a mercenary for Mordor in Lord of the Rings,Giants
I thought Betts was giving signals to Belli. Just bugs. Dodger stadium is a pit,Giants

CRAW DADDY WITH A 440+ HR WOOOO,Giants
Jeez what a nice hit but we can‚Äôt afford anymore injuries,Giants
"according to dodgers sub, the only possible explanation is that crawford is on steroids",Giants
I'm old enough to remember when hitting a ball out of Dodger Stadium during the evening was a rare event.,Giants
You sure that last one wasn‚Äôt a strike angel?,Giants
Make them take out Bauer come on Donnie,Giants

Score me a run

Fuck you hernandez. You‚Äôre a joke of a man,Giants
Angel Hernandez can‚Äôt kneel enough,Giants
0-7 with RISP,Giants
We still winning this game doh,Giants
It's almost impressive how often we'll have a runner on 2nd with no outs and end the inning without even moving him over,Giants
Those 3 at bats were pretty inexcusable. You have to be better in that situation. That fuckin sucked.,Giants
The 0-8 with RISP is killing us. Dodgers have had exactly 1 RISP. We should be wrecking these bums.,Giants
"Trevor Baur telling his fans he has 2 Earned Runs, since they can't read",Giants

That's the most pissed off I have ever seen Kapler get.,Giants
Dave‚Äôs outrage is delightful and reassuring,Giants
They really booing rn?,Giants
Why can‚Äôt Angel Hernandez just have a normal strike call action,Giants
Angel Hernandez has been a terrible umpire for a very long time.,Giants
Oh Jesus he took that hard,Giants
"Oof, that wasn't just an ordinary shinburger. He got all of that ball.",Giants
That makes *my* shin hurt,Giants
I hope Yaz tells angel to go fuck himself,Giants

Oh great. Now it's the fucking cell phone lights. I hate Los Angeles.,Giants
RISP hit challenge [impossible],Giants
0-9 with RISP,Giants

Every fuckkng inning,Giants
"1 run game, offence is going alright, just need a little bit of luck",Giants
Our savior has arrived.  Tauchman has entered the game .  Phew,Giants

2 runs on 10 hits.,Giants
Can we at least never bat Dickerson cleanup again? At least get something out of this (probable) L,Giants
Now we have to deal with Jansen in the 9th with Tuchman leading off. Fucking terrific.,Giants

That at-bat was very unlike Buster. What the fuck was that?,Giants
This team needs to learn how to situationally hit. It will cost them in the long run,Giants

That curve is filthy,Giants
Bauer goes down here,Giants
"if that pitch had been established it's no problem, but Angel why must you decide to be shit at all times",Giants
Not even biased or anything but man the Dodgers are ugly or fake looking.,Giants
there is a STARK difference between Disco's 2 strike offerings vs Bauer's 2 strike offerings ... it is insane.,Giants
Well screw the MLB app for consistently being 30 seconds ahead of my YouTube TV stream ü•¥,Giants

"Another 1 pitch out üòç

Getting 1.2 out of Sherfy would be a coup.",Giants
I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just never not a good time to laugh at the fact that the Hollywood team is THIS DAMN UGLYYYY,Giants
Amazing we are outhitting the Dodgers by 9-5 yet are losing. Smh.,Giants
Kinda surprised there‚Äôs no pinch runner for Flo,Giants
fuck ANGEL,Giants
Hernandez is GIFTING Dodgers pitchers who cannot hit the zone with their high breaking balls.,Giants
Pretty wild that ALL of the runs this game are from solo HRs,Giants
This is the inning boys no fuckin up,Giants
Come on Donny,Giants
The combination of Tyler Rogers and Angel Hernandez is genuinely so fucking scary to me; he won‚Äôt get a single strike,Giants
multiple runners/hits in 6 of 8 innings (hit in 7 of 8 innings) but 0-11 with RISP and here we are,Giants
Fuck how does that not get by!!!!,Giants
How the fuck is Smith catching all these?,Giants
Nice AB,Giants
Good bunt,Giants
That‚Äôs a sac bunt on the scorecard lol,Giants
Well alright Casali it‚Äôs your time again pal,Giants
"Not even gonna lie, Casali been hitting better than Dubon and Slater",Giants
our depth is definitely being tested rn,Giants
That was the one curt,Giants
So many wasted opportunities tonight,Giants
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Angel called that a fuckin strike,Giants
This is frustrating,Giants
Ffffuuuuuuuuck,Giants
Absolutely pathetic. How many chances can you blow with RISP? This is disgraceful.,Giants
Just one of those games. This shit can not fucking happen against the dodgers,Giants
0 for fucking 13 with RISP,Giants
Fucking bullshit offense showed up tonight. Couldn't even manufacture a run with all these runners left on base,Giants
My god man 10 hits and no base runners sent home,Giants
get two leadoff walks. TWO.,Giants
We basically stared the inning with someone on second...and still nothing. I am beyond mad,Giants
Why TF did we use Casali instead of anyone else. It's like drawing up a play for Draymond for a GW 3 just cause he made a 3 after airballing 4 before that,Giants
Leone is the right call. Cannot imagine a worse situation in which to use Tyler Rogers than this game with this ump.,Giants
"I didn‚Äôt get mad with Oakland but with this team, these stuck up privileged assholes boils my blood.",Giants
imagine if we had flores batting cleanup instead of dick.,Giants
"Hitting Casali there is a perfect example of why I still don‚Äôt like Kapler. Just a nonsensical move in every sense. 

This is the most frustrating game of the year so far.",Giants
"This team can have a guy 5 feet from home, with no outs and still find a way to not score.",Giants
I like Mookie but too bad he‚Äôs a dodger‚Ä¶.,Giants
Rather go down 123 then choke a rally in the 9th tbh,Giants
Tauchman and Dickerson in the 9th is going to be rough,Giants
"[Arise RBIs, arise!](https://i.imgur.com/QkV7d4Q.gif)",Giants
this moment was made for tauchman.,Giants
He might be safe,Giants
This is the most infuriating 50-27 team of all time,Giants
"Do I think he was safe? Yes

Am I biased? Maybe

Do I think NY will overturn? No",Giants
#FUCK YOU NEW YORK!,Giants
That‚Äôs such a stupid fucking rule dude,Giants
Can‚Äôt really blame Tauchman. He sees the ball kick away and it‚Äôs just instincts at that point.,Giants
i think he was safe but they weren‚Äôt gonna overturn ruling on field,Giants
Dickerson has missed so many meatballs today,Giants
"What a shit show

Fuck LA",Giants
Pathetic.  Horrible loss.,Giants
"We better win tomorrow, no excuse for this one",Giants
Offense couldn‚Äôt get it done with our best hitters with RISP. Disappointing and reminiscent of prior years,Giants
"Ahh fuck, it‚Äôs gonna be one of those games",Giants
Oh my lord I hate Bauer‚Äôs face,Giants
"The fireworks BEFORE the final out, absolutely fucking classless franchise.",Giants
I'm here to say BAET LA,Giants

"Oh great, we got Angel tonight?",Giants
Fuck angel hernandez,Giants
Not this again‚Ä¶,Giants
Angel being Angel. A fucking loser and pathetic excuse as a father.,Giants
I came in wondering why the hell that call was so bad. My question was immediately answered,Giants
I'm getting us vs Angel's ump vibes,Giants
I know the umps get score cards after each game. How can Hernandez get angry that he doesn‚Äôt get to ump the WS given his history?,Giants
Fuck us‚Ä¶,Giants
@#$!@#$!@#$!@,Giants
This feels not good,Giants
hmm... that's unfortunate,Giants
"Posey calling a fastball down the middle on 1-2 was the problem. Disco executed the pitch, it was just a stupid pitch to throw.",Giants
Dam son,Giants
"I think the top half really messed the giants up, it‚Äôs not hard to get mentally fucked when you have that happen to you, that‚Äôs gotta be fireable offense but Hernandez is just going to be keep playing the race card",Giants
Not only is Angel Hernandez bad at calling strikes; his strike calling motion is sad.,Giants
Good pitch. Check him.,Giants
Really Bauer?? Are you joking me?? Really dude?,Giants
Bauer wanted the same cheat call.,Giants
"We‚Äôre getting pitches, and Disco won‚Äôt have to lead off next inning",Giants
Jesus Christ I hate Bauer‚Äôs face.,Giants
Jon Miller never change,Giants
Is that rosin on the brim of bauers cap?,Giants
"I know Lux is still young and all, but sheesh. For a top prospect with a lot of hype his numbers really aren‚Äôt that great, for the past two seasons now",Giants
Made him look like DeSclafani on strike 3!,Giants
Is it just me or does DeSclafani look like a stegosaurus?,Giants
Let's go Wade Baby! Set the table again!,Giants
Disco has settled down. All we need now are some runs! Let‚Äôs go.,Giants
Disco lookin better now - let‚Äôs get some run support,Giants
Nice work Disco üï∫üèº,Giants

0-3 with RISP,Giants
Longo get well soon please,Giants
"BYE BYE BABY, fucking love that shit. Gimme more!!!!!",Giants
We still winning this game.,Giants
"I'm just happy we don't have a free out (Casali, Tauchman, Dubon) in the lineup aside from the pitcher",Giants
We‚Äôre gonna lock onto Bauer the next time through,Giants
"Btw, 19-27 when we fall behind at some point",Giants
Giants working the count on Bauer is making me horny,Giants
Lol the one Giants fan they show looks like a Hollywood version of a Jersey Shore cast mate,Giants
how sticky is gnat repellent w/ sweat and rosin? would you be suspended for it?,Giants

Anyone else weathering this crazy heat wave up in the PNW? I've got no A/C (not unusual here) and its 90 inside,Giants

Stay hot Wilmer,Giants
"I know we got the best record in the league right now, but why does it feel like we‚Äôre always the underdog?",Giants
Duggar wants to take the lead lmao,Giants

One run homers arent the end of the world,Giants
disco can pitch to anybody but the dodgers lmao,Giants
It's okay.  We'll give them hope and then make a comeback in later innings.  Got em right where we want em.,Giants
Bauer puts ice in his beer,Giants
They‚Äôre doing the wave.,Giants
Good guy Trevor bauer wanted the inning over too,Giants
It‚Äôs alright just gotta get DeSclafani to keep the ball down when he‚Äôs ahead in the count. We already have 6 hits were on Bauer it looks like we just need a big hit or 2 and we‚Äôre cooking,Giants
A lot of game left to be played,Giants
Goddamn Kapler is jacked.  Dave Fleming miring for sure.,Giants
Store was out of Coors light and bud light. I did get MGD light and the flaming hot cheetos. Plus I got some hard seltzer and 1 gatorade.,Giants

FTD,Giants
Angel Hernandez is BIASED AS FUCK,Giants
"Okay, I touched grass, decided to come back, have a plan.

Step One: Posey calls for a high fastball, middle.

Step Two: ‚ÄúOops! My command‚Äôs been shaky all night and I just happened to miss by a couple feet up, and Posey couldn‚Äôt quite get to it either!‚Äù

Step Three: Look all hangdog as AH leaves the field to a teary standing ovation from his fellow Dodger fans.

Step Four: Profit.",Giants

"**Giants fans and the not so written rules of Baseball Redditoring:**

#**Welcome to Slam Francisco‚Äôs GDT**

**1. Fair Warning**

Under no circumstances feel the need to go jump on r/dodgers and go talk shit on their sub. That‚Äôs just some bush league redditoring move my dude/dudette. Now should they do it ‚Ä¶go do that Voodoo that you do so well!

**2. This Weekend‚Äôs contest - A modest blurb -**

3 Game series against the LAtrine Dodgers. So my buddy Billy called me this morning to bet a pair of 4 pack speciality beers that the Dodgers are winning this series. That‚Äôs how confident their fanbase is that the Giants are just not real. I took that bet cause Fuck the Dodgers and Fuck Billy. Go Giants!

**3. Things that are Fair Game**

SoCal and the city of Los Angeles. Any Hollywood star that shows up to the game, their stadium, Dodgers‚Äô fan‚Äôs appearance, attitude, silly shit they do in the stands, Dodgers‚Äô manager and coaches, and any of their fucking players like Max Muncemeat and Trevor Blegher

**4. For any New sub. Welcome!** We upvote around here, give free awards and we do not tolerate trolls so if your goal is to cause a ruckus you will be sniffed out by the sub vets and tossed by the mods.

**Sub membership is at 51,325 as of today! up almost 2000 since last week!**

**Know your acronyms and terms.**

**Such as FTD. Fuck the Dodgers!** ‚ÄúObligatory‚Äù is not necessary. You are already here, we got you ü§ôüèª. We don't do the wave, the WOOO! or have an annoying organist. We simply show up, show out, so bring your glove and grab some garlic fries. If Tony isn't playing at the end of the night... Well don't worry there is always tomorrow! That is the magic of baseball.

**FTU. Fuck this Ump! üò§üò§**

**BEAT LA. BAET LA.-** Beat Los Angeles. Crush em, no mercy, on every front, full Cobra Kai. Because when you say BEAT LA! You say it with venom. BAET LA if you wish to reference a particular facepalming group of Giants fans from a few years ago. https://i.imgur.com/aY956SZ.gif

**NOBLETIGER=** that situation where there's No Outs, the Bases are Loaded, and yet the inning Ends with the Team Incapable of scoring Easy Runs. The Giants are notorious for doing this. Bases loaded! No outs! Hey, let's score! Result: no one scores.

**TOOTBLAN=** bad baserunning, usually because of an ill-advised attempt to steal a base. Thrown Out On The Basepath Like a Nincompoop.

**Fuck this fucking Bullpen, Bullpoo, Bullpoop, Shitpen, etc.**

Our current status regarding the stable of beleaguered special pitchers. They have been doing better!  14 Blown saves tho and many of them coming in the 8/9 innings‚Ä¶

**Clench Up, Maximum Clench, Clench Mode engaged**

For when the situation is about to get hairy, looks to be downhill or terrifying. Particularly when our suspect bullpen takes the mound or if any batters are up with runners in scoring position (RiSP) Clenching pertains to all of the following, asscheeks, facial muscles, neck muscles, fists, and stomach. In the event you shit yourself or you feel sick to your stomach, know that clenching has failed, time for a good cry and a shower.

**GRAB SOME PINE üå≤ MEAT üçñ!-**

Favorite saying of Mike Krukow 1/2 of our TV announcing pair for whenever an opposing batter strikes out in devastating fashion whether by swinging outta his shoes or getting frozen by a well executed pitch.

**DEEP DRIVE TO _____! IT‚Ä¶ IS‚Ä¶ OUTTA HERE!!-**

Favorite call from play by play man and the other half of our incredible broadcasting duo Duane Kuiper whenever a Giants player hits a homer.

**MAGIC WANDU-**

It's something that our TV play-by-play guy, former Giants 2nd baseman Duane Kuiper (""KIGH-perr"") likes to say. It really just means something like ""typical crazy baseball bullshit luck""‚Äîusually he'll call something ‚Äúmagic wandu‚Äù when directly related to bloop hits or perfectly placed batted balls. Like the bat is a magic wand to be able to put it fair where nobody can catch it.

**DAG YABEL-**

Here's the origin of DAG YABEL. https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=QZayuXBq_O0 If you look closely you can actually see it written behind K&K in the booth, among other famous phrases.

**BABYRUBS-**

Happened around like 2016 or 2017, one of the users here was a new parent and others were poking playful fun at it, I don't remember the exact context.

**Karl the Fog-**

Here in the Bay Area we have even named the fog layer that will sometimes invade the stadium!

**ADIOS PELOTA-**

Spanish for ""goodbye ball""‚Äîthis is one of radio announcer Jon Miller's calls for a homer by a Giant. Jon Miller is sometimes on the TV side as well‚Äîhe and Kuiper will switch up during games just to keep things interesting. Miller is in the Baseball Hall of Fame as an announcer, and he is one of the all-time greats.

**Pants Off/On-**

Quick history on why we take our pants off after a win: some years ago, during the Bruce Bochy era, we were celebrating a win in the post-game thread. Someone new to the sub (and maybe to baseball?) didn't know what POTG meant (it means Player of the Game). S/he asked, ""What's POTG mean, anyway? Pants off, that's game?!"" Immediately this became the rallying cry when we win. We take our pants off to celebrate.

**5. Know what the Opposition is saying**

We aren‚Äôt supposed to be here. In the middle of a rebuild. Buncha nobodies. No names. Steroids and blood doping. Must be cheating. Giants success is unsustainable. We can‚Äôt hit. Inconsistent. Mis-managed. We‚Äôve been Farhan‚Äôd. Won‚Äôt make it to All-Star break. Gonna fail. Bunch losers. Our division rival subs are all questioning what is going on in the Bay and doing enough mental gymnastics to produce bulletin board material so you don‚Äôt have to! Just kick back, open an anchor steam and enjoy the show! Stay humble my brothers and sisters.

**Remember fellow Redditor Giants fans. We‚Äôve heard worse and got 3 trophies in a museum to prove it.**

*See something missing please feel free to comment below or DM me personally. This is updated at the start of every series GDT. Thank you for all the kind comments and have a great day.*",Giants

Wow fuck us hard,Giants
Going to need those 4hrs,Giants
Disco out there tossing a quick BP before the actual game starts.,Giants
"If the word ""hate"" was written on every grain of sand in the Sahara Desert, it still wouldn't encapsulate just how much I hate Maximum Muncy.",Giants
What the fuck is happening,Giants
Hopefully Disco settles in after the first,Giants
Makeup call #1 of many we are already entitled to not feeling guilty,Giants
"That‚Äôs a rough start

a shaky shaky start

I just don‚Äôt think you understand",Giants
"Posey, Disco is delivering the pitches you want. Choose better.",Giants
This feels like the first game against Bauer,Giants
Alright Dug get your launch on,Giants
We got this,Giants
Slippy Turner is the best turner,Giants
"Very different scouting report vs last go around, lots of breakers early in count. Doesn‚Äôt have the same fastball",Giants
"goddammit, he chased ball four",Giants
"sticky or not , Bauer has thrown some filthy stuff to both lefties and righties already ...",Giants
Stupid mid inning commercials being twice as loud. Spooked the floof on my lap,Giants
Oh Bauer‚Äôs gonna have a whine fest with Hernandez back there lmao,Giants
0-1 with RISP,Giants
"Why am I suddenly remembering the mad respect Bauer had for Gausman with the Mickey Mouse Cy Young?

Probably because it was Gausman and he‚Äôs amazing.",Giants
"so thinking back to the pitching performances against la as a whole, webb oddly might be *the* dodgers killer aside from gausman",Giants
Mookie Betts calls his mother collect.,Giants
One only giants fan in a sea of blue in that tv shot,Giants
that 90mph ball was a strikeout to posey,Giants
Good T-Bone. Settle into a nice medium rare,Giants
Pollack just looks like a dirtbag,Giants
T BONE,Giants
Nice work Disco!,Giants
Jon making fun of Dodger fans showing up late lol,Giants
"I know I‚Äôm about to unintentionally shade our lord and savior, Colorado native and childhood Giants fan Kevin Gausman, here, but I can‚Äôt imagine not rooting for the team from where you grew up.",Giants
WADE!!!,Giants
**WADE JR.**,Giants
Betts is no Tauchman.,Giants
#LaMonte!!!,Giants
He doesn‚Äôt wanna go back down,Giants
Tauchman woulda caught that,Giants
"But no seriously, imagine trading this guy for Shaun Anderson.",Giants
Wade is the best,Giants
Take a long look Trevy,Giants
what disrespect they sent this guy down. whoever did it should get their pink slip tomorrow,Giants
Wade baby!,Giants
Flair changed !,Giants
Wade should never be optioned,Giants
Posey revenge AB,Giants
Nice double Buster!!!,Giants
Buster Double!,Giants
Lol he misses his sticky stuff,Giants
Love to see it.,Giants
Dick stood no chance on that pitch lol. That was nasty,Giants
It‚Äôs okay I still love Dick,Giants
I hate the Dodgers,Giants
Craw couldn‚Äôt have hit that more into the shift if he tried.,Giants
"*""A mighty cut, and he didn't get it!""*",Giants
Did the organist just play BTS? Lol,Giants
Lol fly bugging Mookie.,Giants
"Calm down, Betts. It wasn‚Äôt that close.",Giants
Ladies and Gentlemen; the Supreme overlord of Baseball: Dookie Butts,Giants
Major clench going on here.,Giants
"Clearly a ball, but Mookie's jump was totally unnecessary and trying to trick Angel.",Giants
They started the mfing ad early lol.,Giants
Muncy's crouch on the pump fake was gold.,Giants
Justin Turner has always been the most terrifying Dodger to me...always seems to hit a double off us,Giants
do you think giants will pick up cueto's 22 MM option for next yr?,Giants
OOF please don‚Äôt throw that again Disco,Giants
Man need to get it closer to the zone at least make em think about it,Giants
incredible strike,Giants
Game hanging in the balance this early.,Giants
Really hoping we can make an out here.,Giants
Pls Disco,Giants
Phew,Giants
thank goodness,Giants
And unclench,Giants
Oof Wilmer wanted to tie the game there,Giants
"At the Humane Society, they had to tie a steak around Max Muncy's neck to get any dogs to interact with him",Giants
They need to check Betts at second,Giants
"The Giants have very little money on the books next yr, I am guessing you take the Posey option. Is the owner going to let Zaidi go hog-wild and spend a lot of money this offseason or did he hire Zaidi (former A's guy) to do more with less.",Giants
Bow bow Bauer wheels,Giants
"Wilmer: 2

Bauer: 0

Suck it, bad guy.",Giants
"We gotta stop sending LWJ down, dude is clutch every time he gets brought up",Giants
Alright Dug let‚Äôs get launchy but actually this time,Giants
Flowers > Bauers,Giants
I gotta admit that is a gorgeous sunset,Giants
"Yeah, you see some nice sunsets at the ravine, but no place has a view like Oracle",Giants
"Hello friends I am now paying attention to the game after playing some volleyball (and fucking up my shoulder whoops)

Perhaps my shoulder will be the sacrifice we need?",Giants
"Angel Hernandez waves his arm for a strike like he's signaling a touchback on a kickoff. 


Maybe that's the problem... he thinks he's officiating a football game???",Giants
bunt moment,Giants
Another one LaMonte? ü•∫,Giants
Dude what is with the camera angle where you can‚Äôt see the ball cross the plate,Giants
At least LaMonte has a chance to save us again,Giants
LWJ clutch incoming,Giants
Muncy started charging that bunt during the windup,Giants
fuck that must have hurt,Giants
"Bauer wants to do that posing he does, swinging his arms. Holds back.",Giants
"Angel Hernadez

Trevor Bauer

Rob Manfred

....not on my Xmas card list",Giants
"Some people here need to chill, it's a one run game with 5 innings left, and we're having good ABs and getting some hits, it's not like last night where everyone was striking out on 4 pitches",Giants
Well that pretty much confirms Bauer is a dirty cheater for me,Giants
"Pitchers are so bad at hitting these days, they don't teach em how to bunt anymore. I fucking hate the DH but it's obviously what's going to happen.",Giants
Fucking wankers,Giants
All hits are HR,Giants
3 hits and they‚Äôre all home runs. What a fucking joke.,Giants
"I'm okay with starting up the Bullpen.. Not a knock-on Disco, just happens like this sometimes.. Gotta not let it out of control..",Giants
Attaboy Disco,Giants
LOL,Giants
"Disco is having the same issues that Cueto has had when he's off - his pitches aren't bad apart from a few, but his 'tempt' pitches outside the zone have been way missed for easy takes. If he is even a little more accurate on his pitches ahead in the count, his pitch count drops into the 50s easily. Thankfully his stuff is so dang good that only the solo dingers have hurt us",Giants
I still can‚Äôt believe Wade didn‚Äôt swing at that fucking pitch,Giants
Is it really that much darker in LA right now than it is here or is it just the stadium lights making the sky look darker?,Giants
Damn they just came at him!!!!,Giants
Angel come on man,Giants
Angel feels bad that MLB took away Bauer‚Äôs advantage so he‚Äôs giving him a new one,Giants
That strike was higher than Bellinger.,Giants
damn it effing bellinger,Giants
"All the games on this road trip are night games, even 4th of July.",Giants
[removed],Giants
Great effort Mookie,Giants
"He‚Äôs just not throwing anything worth chasing, so many wasted pitches",Giants
That wave is what prompted the double play.,Giants
"for as bad as Disco has looked, he has consistently been ahead in counts. This is a tough tough lineup to face amd a nice DP",Giants
disco hasn't been good but if the offense can't hit no-sticky bauer we deserve to lose anyway. the zone is helping him but still,Giants
TWO! A double play.,Giants
Dongs incoming,Giants
Max Muncy invented the wave.,Giants
YEEEEE JUST WATCH THAT GO CODY,Giants
CHEESE STEAK!!!! I MEAN CRAWFORD,Giants
"""giants have some work to do"" lol",Giants
Good after the 2nd inning curve he just missed,Giants
NUTTED,Giants
HOLY COW CRAWDADDY,Giants
jumped on that first pitch...fuck yeah!,Giants
Wasted no time. Love it.,Giants
My goodness,Giants
CRAWFORD,Giants
BCRAWüî•,Giants
FUCK YOU BAUER,Giants
Would be nice if... you know... they could do this with people on base.,Giants
444 ft‚Ä¶ ANGEL NUMBERS,Giants
Let em know Craw! These sorry ass fans were voting for Seager over you.,Giants
ü¶ûüçÜüí¶ü¶ûüçÜüí¶ü¶ûüçÜüí¶ü¶ûüçÜüí¶,Giants
Lets go Flores,Giants
Just missed it Wilmer,Giants
damn so close,Giants
"Fuck, I thought that was gone!",Giants
ADIO-off the top of the wall!,Giants
Wilmer has to hit the ball hard since he runs like Fred Sanford.,Giants
Please be OK Wilmer ü•∫,Giants
This is wild. So glad I turned this game on. Go Giants!,Giants
Stop unzipping your jacket bro lol,Giants
Don‚Äôt worry Donnie Barrels that would‚Äôve been called a strike,Giants
Trevor Bauer's favorite part of *The Godfather* is when Sonny gets shot up.,Giants
slider low away,Giants
"Watch out, He‚Äôs got that laser focus! I saw it in his eyes",Giants
Goddammit,Giants
the giants piss me off,Giants
Let Ruf pitch,Giants
"Oh, I see. Only solo home runs count tonight.",Giants
Alright let‚Äôs hope for the good Jarlin,Giants
Gotta love the new Dodgers Twitter talking point of steroids,Giants
Like rationally I know Bellinger won an MVP but the dude is always staring at pitches in the zone or throwing his back out swinging at pitches outside of it lmfaoooo,Giants
Will smith looks like he‚Äôd kill his parents to throw a dumb house party,Giants
Will Smith looks like DeSclafani‚Äôs annoying little brother that his mom forced to bring to play with his friends.,Giants
why the fuck does Chris Taylor do that thing with his bat,Giants
Sit the fuck down,Giants
3/\3\//,Giants
Let‚Äôs fucking go boys!,Giants
‚ÄúStrike one!‚Äù,Giants
"‚ÄúOh, fuck, my calls are reviewable?‚Äù",Giants
Angel trying his DAMNDEST to hand this one to the Dodgers,Giants
Hernandez is blind as a bat. He‚Äôs an embarrassment to the game,Giants
Flemming keeping it real about Hernandez rn,Giants
"OK, now that is either straight incompetence or favoritism. Whichever way, this fucking ump should be ejected by the next ump in charge.",Giants
Ow Yaz,Giants
Bust out the tuning fork for gods sakes,Giants
Why aren‚Äôt the announcers traveling with the team now? The parks are all at full capacity.,Giants
I'm sure shit head ump wanted to call that a strike.,Giants
Posey needs to put  this squad ahead with a big fly,Giants
heyy weren‚Äôt rally lights our thing like 3 years ago,Giants
Dodger fans stealing our rally lights,Giants
Keep the line moving boys,Giants
BDE time!,Giants
Why are these jerks waving their phones around?,Giants
Pls Dick,Giants
Let‚Äôs fucking do this!,Giants
Posey's numbers against lefties are nutty,Giants
those rally lights for us?!‚Ä¶ I hope so!!!,Giants
"Don‚Äôt harsh our mellow, Dick.",Giants
I'm not feeling too confident about this dick at bat. I hope he proves me wrong.,Giants
please don't giants this up,Giants
Pls pls pls hr,Giants
C'mon! I'm looking for some good dick! Wait...,Giants
Wade stole a ball with that steal threat.,Giants
"Every single out we get with RISP takes a year off my life, I swear to god I'm so desperate at this point",Giants
i already know this outcome,Giants
Come on. Kidding me. Lead off walk and we don‚Äôt score a run. Unreal.,Giants
"Moment of silence for all the Dodger fans who are gonna take home a Max Muncy bobblehead tomorrow, I‚Äôm sorry guys, rivalry be damned",Giants
Fuck. I hope it‚Äôs just a precaution.,Giants
have faith,Giants
so tauchman is in. lol. great.,Giants
Just need one come on,Giants
Sherfy looks pretty good tonight!,Giants
Just have to get Wade up a couple more times and we'll be good.,Giants
Gimme that Crawdaddy special,Giants
Looking at Duggar for this inning. Treinen has a lot of movement but Duggar has really excelled against hard stuff.,Giants
"Dang, that had a bit of hang to it",Giants
"flores is on fire, imagine if he was batting 4th",Giants
Holy moly I just checked Duggar‚Äôs BABIP this year and it‚Äôs .462 lol. Quite literally half the ball he hit have been base hits this season.,Giants
Flores is ON ONE üí®,Giants
Craw leaving this game with 18 HR's will be exciting.,Giants
LETS DO SOMETHING WITH IT PLEASE,Giants
I am once again asking for an RBI hit,Giants
Please don‚Äôt fuck this up.,Giants
"#HARD, HUGE BALL!",Giants
Cmon Steven!,Giants
Duggar pls feel free to save the day. Again.,Giants
Don‚Äôt bunt with Flores who can‚Äôt run wtf Krukow,Giants
‚ÄúDo you give up an out to put runners in scoring position‚Äù NO,Giants
Make it hurt Giants,Giants
Wow how are we gonna blow this one with 3 outs to go??,Giants
HOLY SHIT a high ball called properly.,Giants
Alright boys. Time to strap up again,Giants
If we can‚Äôt score here we deserve to lose,Giants
"Come on treinan, spike one to the backstop",Giants
Effectively a bunt,Giants
A PRODUCTIVE OUT WITH RISP I WILL FUCKING TAKE IT,Giants
"glorified bunt and it wasn't a double play, so whatever",Giants
actually productive holy shit,Giants
*not a double play*,Giants
"Eh, could have been worse",Giants
That‚Äôs why bunting isn‚Äôt always the right call. So many other ways to move the runner over. Not to mention Flores can‚Äôt run.,Giants
for the love of god please hit a fly ball,Giants
‚Äú2 runners in scoring position‚Äù FUCK,Giants
Good at bat.  Flores got to third with 1 out.,Giants
Come on flair come through..,Giants
Curt gonna do something big,Giants
Oh yes gimme some curt,Giants
Just a little poke Casali my dude. I'd even settle for a good sac fly right now,Giants
"Pretty disappointing that Casali is up to bat, but I hope he proves me wrong",Giants
we're so fucked,Giants
Wtf is Kapler doing with that call?,Giants
What a horrendous AB looking at the meatball. That prob the game if Wade doesn't get it,Giants
The hell you put casali out there,Giants
fuck shit bitch man‚Ä¶ looked right at the perfect pitch to give us the lead‚Ä¶ dammit man,Giants
"I loved casali‚Äôs walkoff as much as anyone‚Ä¶ but really, pinching him now?? Half the reason that walkoff was so satisfying is that casali‚Äôs been batting like crap",Giants
‚ÄúStrike 2!‚Äù,Giants
Casali is a straight up shitty hitter,Giants
Punish Robert's for his decision plz,Giants
In LWJ we trust.,Giants
these matchups are being played like the playoffs but the giants aren‚Äôt manufacturing runs. no grind. just hoping for a hr.,Giants
:(,Giants
Rough,Giants
Fuck me sideways 0-13 with RISP,Giants
Just cant get a hit with risp.,Giants
"Wow, what an irritating game",Giants
This is a joke,Giants
"Come the fuck on, guys. Terrible.",Giants
Haha fuck this game. Goodnight.,Giants
I‚Äôm still shaking that Casali took 94 down the middle with no movement for strike one,Giants
"this team used to pull off some major bullshit wins against the Dodgers when they sucked

but now that we‚Äôre at 50 wins and in first place they wanna forget how to hit‚Ä¶. torture",Giants
We seriously can‚Äôt be doing this to Flores right now :((((,Giants
"Buster: ""the fuck outta here with that nonsense""",Giants
"Muncy:

Neckbeard

Fat

Excessive underbite",Giants
Dominic Leone is one thicccc bih,Giants
YOU'RE IN THE LEONE ZONE,Giants
two auto outs + posey coming up next,Giants
"Cmon tauchman. Cmon anyone. Damn, I want this one",Giants
D O N G S out for the SOLO D O N G,Giants
"Leone, The Professional.",Giants
I think I've only ever seen a Giants highlight twice this entire season on these MLB flashbacks between the innings. Meanwhile dodgers get at least one per break,Giants
i am unhappy,Giants
Tauchman redemption arc (part 2) pls,Giants
I mean if Tauchman does something here there‚Äôs some sort of blood magic involved in his game,Giants
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING YOU FUCKING IDIOT,Giants
He‚Äôs safe,Giants
Oh wow it looks like he's safe,Giants
He‚Äôs safe,Giants
He's in!,Giants
Omg is he in?!,Giants
Safe,Giants
"Holy fuck, I think he's actually safe",Giants
Horrible call by the ump,Giants
"These dodgers announcers are dumb as dirt, what happened to Orel?",Giants
Saaaafe,Giants
He‚Äôs safe for sure,Giants
"He actually looks safe to me, still awful baserunning, but I think he's safe",Giants
Fucking bullshit,Giants
I think his body came off the bag,Giants
wow that is absolute bullshit,Giants
Wow,Giants
I really want to know what part of the play made them decide he was out. The only thing I see is the very end of the slide is not 100% clear.,Giants
fucking bullshit,Giants
"Don't get rewarded for a downright stupid decision. 

Oh well.",Giants
One of those calls that's so close that they won't change it. If he was called safe he would probably be safe now.,Giants
That hurt,Giants
Well now we can count on‚Ä¶Dickerson‚Ä¶magic‚Ä¶?,Giants
He‚Äôs safe,Giants
What‚Äôs Dickersons line since coming back,Giants
Sham game,Giants
Well that was painful. Should have won that with all the chances they had,Giants
Well that was annoying.,Giants
"that was safe, FTD",Giants
"No, Flemm, 0 for 13 with RISP is ***not*** ""just the kind of game we expected""",Giants
"God now the narrative around Padre fans is the Giants are cheating and that we will fall to earth in the second half while they play weaker teams, the same teams they've shit the bed against all year(Pirates, Dbacks, etc)....  


I've never seen a fanbase that hasn't won shit, be so entitled. We have more world titles than you have playoff appearances in the last 30 years.",Giants
"Tauchman was safe, fuck this BS",Giants
I hate the stupid Dodgers with their stupid fans and all the stupid help they needed to win by 1 run. Bunch of Mickey Mouse champs who haven‚Äôt seen a real ring in decades.,Giants
I hope the Giants can knock Bauer around now that he can't use Spider Tack or whatever sticky stuff he was using to get an advantage. Also on that note Brandon Crawford's brother in law oh boy.....,Giants
Trevor Bauer was voted most promising minor league player.  This year.,Giants
"Hate how deep the dodgers lineup is. Cant relax against anyone. Only the pitcher, even then..",Giants
Oooooooooohhhhhhhh!!! -Dodger fans on a soft fly out to center.,Giants
Bellinger's real cocky after that misplay.,Giants
"Dodger fan dropping a quick fuck Angel Hernandez. Even if it's going for my team, I just wanna see an accurately called game.",Giants
"This is so good hahaha https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMd5XXofP/

This is exactly how I imagine Belli",Giants
"I've always held this philosophy that you have to heckle as hard as you can, especially in the bleachers, but without cursing. The point is to get under their skin and mess with their focus, not necessarily using violent language. This thread has been a gem so far. I'm saving these for my next game.",Giants
"CHECK BAUER FOR ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES

IT'S TIME",Giants
Dodgers fans make it seem like a homerun everytime the ball touches a bat even if its a pop up behind the plate.,Giants
He came off the bag,Giants
He avoided the tag but he came off the bag.,Giants
dodger fans are a bunch of chodes.  but we all knew that already.,Giants
We got fucked today so hard by both blues they just want the narrative to be all dodgers again,Giants
Max Muncy passes in the right lane,Giants
"Hello you fucks! Just wanted to say I went to your ballpark for the first time on Saturday and thought it was awesome. Plenty of fun banter with some of the fans as I had my Dodger hat on. Unfortunately, you guys won. Hope y‚Äôall lose today! (But seriously, favorite park that I‚Äôve been to.)",Giants
"I remember in 2017-2019 looking at the various shitty records throughout the season and saying to myself, how nice if we could just transpose the numbers, thank you Farhan for making that pipe dream a reality.",Giants
In honor of disco what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite disco tracks? I‚Äôll take any of Sylvester‚Äôs hits,Giants
Max Muncy‚Äôs idea of fancy Italian cuisine is stuffed crust pizza at Pizza Hut,Giants
"Trevor Bauer is so vain that he thinks the Carly Simon song, ""You're So Vain"" is about him.",Giants
Trevor Bauer farts in the locker room and blames it on the least popular guy on the team,Giants
Bauer stole Pence's scooter...,Giants
"$20 says buster calls for a high heater from Disco next inning that juuuuust misses his glove and finds an Angel Hernandez backstop.

Because if I know one thing, it's that Gerald is ***NOT*** to be trifled with.",Giants
"This fat fuck makes me irrationally angry. Why am I watching this, this game is gonna be 7-2 ugh",Giants
Does Disco have the yips against the Dodgers?,Giants
I feel bad for the giant fans at that stadium. Dodger fans love to heckle tf out of you.,Giants
#WILL MOOKIE BETTS BREAK THE PUT OUT RECORD TONIGHT?!?! STAY TUNED!!!,Giants
Max Muncy: big fan of Nickelback and Creed.,Giants
#**THAT'S MY ALL STAR SHORT STOP**,Giants
This RISP problem is what happens when half the lineup is a black hole and the other half is playing their asses off,Giants
If you accept the L this becomes really funny,Giants
Umm?? Earthquake?,Giants
Trevor Bauer eats his yogurt with chopsticks,Giants
Imagine being inside dodger stadium without full on tactical armor,Giants
Hmm Disco has a 1.84 ERA on the road. Good to know.,Giants
let's give this a shot,Giants
"Are we in the flyover states?!?

Edit: Dave liked the anthem",Giants
4 giant home runs today. But 10ks against Bauer. Calling my shot. Hope we have some guys on base for those,Giants
Yay wade! Oh boy Angel Hernandez night....,Giants
Looks like we already did something the Bums couldn't do against the Cubs,Giants
Trevor Bauer looks like Kaepora Gaebora,Giants
Lamonte ‚ÄúLamonte Wade Jr‚Äù Wade Jr,Giants
What the fuck.,Giants
Classic Hernandez,Giants
Uh,Giants
I have no words,Giants
At least they are making some solid contact,Giants
Where can I get some of Whatever angel is smoking?,Giants
Anyone wanna try to get one of those Muncy bobbleheads so we can blow it up in a field?,Giants
Godfuckingdammit,Giants
Well here run on the board,Giants
Uh oh...,Giants
Okay then,Giants
"I am not saying this just because he gave a homer, but isn‚Äôt disco usually second in the rotation?",Giants
oh my god what the fuck,Giants
I hate it,Giants
Perfect,Giants
Fuck,Giants
Aight back to the Sopranos‚Ä¶,Giants
Jesus Christ. I quit.,Giants
Muncy kills us man,Giants
"Man, T-Bone is just missing over the middle of the plate. Wonder if it's too early to go for a mound visit if he keeps doing it.",Giants
Meatballs,Giants
"Oh, it‚Äôs gonna be one of those games‚Ä¶..shit",Giants
"At least uh, the pitch count isn‚Äôt terrible?",Giants
"K!

You got this Disco",Giants
I hope Disco can calm down but it's worrying because Bauer looked filthy in his first inning aside from the Wade hit,Giants
A HIT!,Giants
"God dammit that stinky guy who closes doors too loudly, Patrick Wisdom, hit a home run üò°üò°",Giants
let's gooooo,Giants
So I'm keeping bare track of this game and looked at the gameday feed and nearly cried. What happened??,Giants
Ball four Duggar,Giants
At least he earned this K,Giants
This Bauer guy is good at baseball unfortunately.,Giants
Time for Disco to hit a HR and pimp it,Giants
Bauer shaking off his catcher like crazy. He's one of *those* pitchers.,Giants
What does the strategy meeting sound like when you know Hernandez is behind the plate lmao,Giants
jump on the first pitch Disco,Giants
In other words: Hernandez' strike zone is shit,Giants
Lol go disco go,Giants
Now the ump is tightening his zone?? Yikes ‚Ä¶,Giants
What are they wooing at? It was a 3 hopper,Giants
Wait he‚Äôs got a curveball?!,Giants
Great bounce back inning for Disco.,Giants
"Like even on the swing, it‚Äôs 1-2 and the dude is swinging out of his shoes on a fastball in an a breaker count

Weird.",Giants
Shot #2,Giants
"Lotta game to go, lotta runs for us to knock in üß°üñ§",Giants
Bauer is missing quite a lot,Giants
"Random question, but is it just me or does it always look like Dodger Stadium has a yellowish-tinted haze, especially during day games?",Giants
Come on that‚Äôs not a strike,Giants
IDGAF we keepin' Wade..,Giants
"I'm sorry Belt, but Wade's got 1B on lock atm",Giants
GOAT. I'm tellin' ya.,Giants
Wade is legendary,Giants
LaMonte's flow is underrated,Giants
Bauer got his baby feet hurt üòû,Giants
"‚ÄúDid he get stepped on?‚Äù

I hope he got kicked!",Giants
Hustle harder !,Giants
LIKE THAT BABY!,Giants
Attaboy Posey. Hey Lites does he look lost now?,Giants

"Oh god, getting ‚Äúthe game‚Äù feelings from this AB w/Bellinger",Giants
Phew,Giants
Way to get out of the jam Disco!,Giants
That way up camera was nauseating.,Giants
"I need to call my own bluff because I said that AB was ‚Äúthe game,‚Äù and‚Ä¶.",Giants
Great job getting out of that jam,Giants
god disco is LABORING boysssss,Giants
"If disco can just get through the 5th without any more runs, I‚Äôd be good with that",Giants
are our broadcasters traveling now?,Giants
Trevor Bauer drinks copious amounts of sparkly water.,Giants
Nice,Giants
Stay hot Wilmer!,Giants
flores is getting the most squib hits lmao,Giants
Nice AB from Flores,Giants
Duggar homer inc,Giants
FU Hernandez,Giants
"Lol shut up Dave, Mookie isn‚Äôt even that good of a fielder.",Giants
Can Disco bunt?,Giants
"Duggat has been absolutely mashing fastballs. So it's up to him to start mashing the offspeed. Credit Bauer there, he located very well.",Giants
lay it down disco,Giants
Shit bunt,Giants
Lol great bunt üôÑ,Giants
i guess i'm happy flores isn't the runner in scoring position?,Giants
LET‚ÄôS GET AFTER IT WADE,Giants
Disco poor bunt,Giants
Awful bunt.,Giants
I also do like what we‚Äôre doing with the pitch count,Giants
You know what they say about ownage,Giants
Fuuuuuck,Giants
"Gotta swing, man.",Giants
What a pitch...,Giants
Nasty. 96 with run. Baseball.,Giants
That was a nasty 2 seamer,Giants
Damn still waiting to get that key hit against this guy,Giants
Trevor *Glower*,Giants
How do we feel?,Giants
Bad bunt and a strikeout looking. That was not good.,Giants
The hand check!,Giants
angel hernandez checking Bauer‚Äôs hand,Giants
Bauer's hands are at least 5 tones lighter than his arms.,Giants
Angel Hernandez just wanted to moisturize Bauer‚Äôs hands,Giants
"Angel, if you toss Bauer for an illegal substance...I won't forgive you for anything, but it'd be cool.",Giants
Fuck Will Smith too,Giants
Fuck me...,Giants
It looked to me like the umps told Bauer to wash something off his hands.,Giants
"Nice 1-2 pitch dude. 

Backbreaker.",Giants
Feels like me playing the show right now. Get 20179502 hits score 1 run give up 3 hits and 3 runs,Giants
"I am triggered by the fact that his name is Will Smith.

There‚Äôs already the Fresh Prince and the former Giant. That‚Äôs about enough.",Giants
Well at least its not a home run,Giants
Nice job dick,Giants
https://i.imgur.com/HfEO2S9.png,Giants
disco needs to throw more pitches like that instead of meatballs while he's ahead,Giants
Nice,Giants
Screamer,Giants
We need one here.,Giants
Hot jambalaya,Giants
What‚Äôs this about Kapler pulling off a shirt,Giants
Angel Hernandez moment,Giants
FTD,Giants
Dick is frustrating a bit. Just don't throw him middle away and he has not done much damage on those pitches. Really easy to pitch around at times,Giants
Offense is inept and pitcher is off. Fuck,Giants
Oh wow came pretty close to executing my plan,Giants
Inept offense other than Wade time!,Giants
Craw please do something,Giants
LIKE BUTTAH,Giants
"Disco pitching alright...not locating well, but has a chance to get a quality start.

Let‚Äôs go offense! 4 spot this inning

Edit: 1 down 3 to go",Giants
Just realized the cheese steak shop alex Dickerson was featured in is nearby where I live. Definitely going to try it now.,Giants
nice,Giants
2 more!,Giants
DINGER TIME!!!,Giants
Let‚Äôs fucking go,Giants
HELL YA CRAWFORD!!!!!,Giants
#WHO'S YOUR DADDY!!,Giants
Only need the one pitch!!!,Giants
"Get fucked, Bauer!",Giants
I wonder why the Monday game moved. From one weird start time to another.,Giants
"As soon as it left the bat, I knew",Giants
Lol. Angel barely had his facemask on.,Giants
Hell yeah!!!,Giants
It‚Äôs a Bazooka BCrawing on Bauer,Giants
awww fuck thought that was gone,Giants
What a tease. Lol,Giants
Wilmer‚Äôs been swinging out of his shoes tonight.,Giants
# Wilmer!,Giants
Aw come on that's supposed to be a home run. Stop the steal!,Giants
"He‚Äôs been playing injured iirc, been running at 50%",Giants

Let‚Äôs go Giants!!!,Giants
Someone get Bauer his sticky shit! lol,Giants
would love a duggar hit here,Giants
C'mon Dugg. You know what to do.,Giants
LESSSSSS GOOOOO!!!!!!!!!,Giants
Bauer always looks like if he doesn't know if it's a fart or shart,Giants
"Duggar is gonna see a lot of breaking balls. Not everyone can locate like Bauer though, so I do trust him still",Giants
" I don't care if we're down and Doobie isn't hitting great, put him in against Bauer so they can play for the sword move! I wanna see Doobie bomb one off B and then do the move!",Giants

Please let Bauer be done for the night‚Ä¶,Giants
"Go back out there for the seventh, Trevor",Giants
Beautiful pitch,Giants
Bellinger got a nice swing with the ugliest batting stance,Giants
Losing  strikes to bad calls against a pitcher like this is such a huge disadvantage. The stretched inconsistent zone basically extends movement of all the breaking balls and amplifies the impact of giving batters different looks.,Giants
John Miller would have blue-balled is there.,Giants
A BLESSING FROM THE BULLPEN,Giants
"WTF. Kap, you best get on this.",Giants
the most painful HBP I've ever seen,Giants
Angel should not have a job,Giants

That pitch was in Dicks wheel house. Hope he gets it again,Giants
come on BCraw‚Ä¶.,Giants
Noooo.... big wasted out.,Giants
Do it again Craw!!!,Giants
Save us Crawdaddy!,Giants
Needs to lay off the cheese steaks.  Slowing the bat down,Giants
Too many FLOB tonight. Can‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt have opportunities.,Giants
Really?,Giants
jfc,Giants
Dang it,Giants
Fuck,Giants
Fuck. Can't imagine we get any better chances than that,Giants
">9 hits

Pathetic execution tonight,Giants
How we going to go 0-10 with RISP. Come on guys...,Giants
So many chances with RISP this game and nothing to show for it,Giants
Fucking why??????,Giants
Gahd that was painful,Giants
I‚Äôm in Pain,Giants
You guys need to really leave some LOBsters for us Twins.,Giants
Is there anyone available to call up? Maybe Jaylin Davis?,Giants
1 pitch out üòç,Giants
Send in Ogie Oglethorpe!,Giants
Did they just let some drunk on the PA system?,Giants
"Excellent. Come on, Sherfy, let‚Äôs go for the full 1.2.",Giants
What an inning,Giants

Can we have something on the menu this inning besides LOBster please,Giants
"Almost the witching hour boys, Charge up those bats ‚ö°Ô∏è",Giants

"NO RUN, ONLY HIT

- Wilmer, Probably

Dude is raking though",Giants
"i'm all for bunting, we can't hit for shit with people on base anyway",Giants
Flores is my man,Giants
"Once again, munch on a bag o dicks Angel.",Giants
If only we could have gotten Flores up with RISP ...,Giants
"Bring flores home, you guys owe him that much",Giants
Cmon Duggar!!!,Giants
I can't even remember the last game we had w a decent home plate ump,Giants
Good eye!,Giants
"Nice AB, glad Angel didn‚Äôt F us in the A on that",Giants
"I thought he was going to punch him out to be honest.

I swear he had a twitch",Giants
it was one of those Duggar Ab‚Äôs,Giants
What an amazing at bat,Giants
I thought for sure that Garbage Ass Bitch was gonna call that strike 3.,Giants
He wanted to call that so bad,Giants
Let him hit.,Giants
here we go boys!!,Giants
#Barrel it Donnie!,Giants
I think let him swing,Giants
BIG time! Here we go.  This Inning is primed for a big gash wide open,Giants
Man Treinen‚Äôs slider is filth,Giants
Aight it‚Äôs time to say it I don‚Äôt think the Dodgers have a lead if the umpire is even somewhat competent.,Giants
good out,Giants
The ole swinging bunt.,Giants
I‚Äôll actually take that.,Giants
PRODUCTIVE OUT I'LL TAKE IT!!!,Giants
"We choose not to bunt, batter tries to pull a low pitch... we're damn lucky we did as well as a bunt",Giants
walk em,Giants
Casali? I like this actually,Giants
Curt Casali in...ESCAPE FROM L.A.,Giants
The big curt,Giants
Damn Will Smith putting on a fucking masterclass,Giants
Take the meat ball,Giants
Come on giants. Fuck this Q-douche up,Giants
Whatever. Dubon and slater wouldn‚Äôt have done anything either,Giants
0-12 with RISP,Giants
same old story,Giants
This game hurts.,Giants
That pitch right down the middle was the one to hit,Giants
How do you not swing at that ball right down the middle?,Giants
"0-12 with RISP is absolutely absurd, if we lose there‚Äôs no way to justify this one",Giants
LaMonte draws a walk and Mikey hits it yard,Giants
Casali striking out??? How weird,Giants
wow what a terrible at bat,Giants
Well there goes the greatest chance for the Giants to tie the game. Thank you shitty 1b ump teaming up with the shitty home plate ump. Thanks. Real cool,Giants
They'll prob pitch around Wade.,Giants
Why the FUCK did he not swing at the pitch right down the fucking middle? God damnit it Casali,Giants
Casali had no chance tbh,Giants
I'm not sure about Casali as a pinch hitter...,Giants
Casali‚Äôs AB made me very sad,Giants
are we really going to go 0-13 with RISP!?!,Giants
Dodgers seem to know not to mess with clutch time Tauchman lol,Giants
unintentional intentional walk right here,Giants
Classic Giants!!!!,Giants
Sheeeeeit,Giants
AHH Giants torture,Giants
Wade is looking like Rizzo with how much he crowds the plate.,Giants
Bruh,Giants
Welp the torture knows no bounds,Giants

The baseball gods just don't want us to win this game,Giants
"Out of all the pinch hitters,  why did he use Casali?  Smh",Giants
This has been a very frustrating game,Giants
This is so frustrating,Giants
"Wow, we are really good at NOT scoring against this team",Giants
"Scattering our hits tonight, damn.",Giants
Pathetic with men in scoring position,Giants
ü•∫,Giants
Casali wasn‚Äôt due to run into one for another couple weeks.,Giants
Why does Gabe hate Slater?,Giants
Damn. Only runs we score are through dingers. I want to see this team rally,Giants
"What a depressing, shitty game",Giants
Who wants to see some Manfredball tonite!?!?!? Seems fitting for this game!,Giants
Wtf was that? Casali is a prone strikeout hitter and now we lose our backup catcher with Posey himself being injury prone. Just an awful horrific move,Giants
NOICE CURVE,Giants
The dog shit hitting is wasting all this good pitching.,Giants
While mookie was hella impressive doing that ball trick it was way more impressive of buster tracking and then catching that in the slow mo,Giants
Want an out? Hit it to (to?) Crawford!,Giants
Sockman is gonna run into one,Giants
Max Muncy rides to the stadium in a horse drawn carriage and tries to hawk handmade furniture to everyone in the clubhouse.,Giants
Dodgers fans boo at everything i swear to god,Giants

Sorry for the slander earlier today bullpen. You guys have been awesome today so far!,Giants
Those were some sweet sweet sings & misses.,Giants
Here we go boys!!! This is the kinda torture ball Giants live for!!,Giants
I think the only big question is how many pitches it takes to K Tauchman and how many pitches it takes for the weak Dick flyball,Giants
"Alright, it‚Äôs fucking clutch time! It‚Äôs ONE RUN to tie, 2 to win! Let‚Äôs goooooo",Giants
"Can we get a free runner in the 9th Mr. Manfred?

Not like we‚Äôd be able to score anyways",Giants

That's bullshit.,Giants
Bullshit,Giants
No fucking way he has a legit argument,Giants

Posey you really got to hit a bomb here,Giants
Time to DFA Tauchman,Giants

Angel called that WP a ball?,Giants
96 right down the middle that‚Äôs the best you could ask for,Giants
"Will Smith, I'mma need you to let one get past you k thanksss.",Giants
idk if I want to see Flores go for home on a WP,Giants
FFS!,Giants
Uggggghhhhhhhhh not going to get a better pitch than that................,Giants
what an awful at-bat. we're not going to get anything.,Giants
Watched the best pitch he was gonna see go right by,Giants
Can we just get a sac fly plz,Giants
Taking that first strike was brutal fuck,Giants
The giants bench is fucking awful at hitting,Giants
Oh god theyre probably not pitching to wade with Tauchman on deck,Giants
"Fucking hell Casali, my granny could see that pitch was a ball‚Ä¶",Giants
If we don't score here we don't deserve to win this game at all,Giants
LFG WADE!!! BEAT LA!!!!!,Giants
"This is their chance. This is it, come on",Giants
Getting 2 strikes against a guy with Treinens stuff is a death sentence. Rough swing call.,Giants
In Wade we trust.,Giants
WADE HR INCOMING,Giants
"There‚Äôs no way we don‚Äôt score

Edit fuck my dumb hands",Giants
We have no LHB? We have nobody who can run for Wilmer (not even a pitcher)? Where's the urgency -- wait until the 9th?,Giants
LFG Wade,Giants
Take the lead and get to Tauchman!,Giants
this team drives me nuts,Giants
Casali is a high strikeout rate guy why would you pinch hit him here,Giants
Nice take,Giants
He really wanted a piece of him this time.  And not just the Jersey,Giants
Walk to wade for sockman glory,Giants
God fucking damnit,Giants
Dammit,Giants
inning over popup,Giants
"Existential pain. 


Also are they trying to kill Wade?",Giants
L,Giants
*ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof.*,Giants
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS,Giants
Baseball.,Giants
why do the fucking dodgers do this to us ALL THE TIME!! jesus christ man,Giants
"Treinen is ridiculous. All of his pitches are +. One Tauch, Posey, or Dick has to run into one",Giants
Praying for a Buster game tying home run,Giants
Great pitch there,Giants
That‚Äôs the only contact you‚Äôre getting this AB!,Giants
Wade gotta learn how to put the proper foot on the bag,Giants
Leon is on fire,Giants
We got his guys.  God is a giants fan. It‚Äôs clear.,Giants
I hope Mr Leone is married to Sunny.,Giants
Gotta find another outfielder that can hit whether that guy is already with us or by trade I think it‚Äôs necessary if we wanna make some real noise in the playoffs,Giants
Ah we‚Äôre fucked it‚Äôs Kenley,Giants
I could watch that Tauchman catch all day,Giants
Tauchman up so 1 out already,Giants
"on the bright side, there's no possible way that they can be this unclutch tomorrow",Giants
The f is Jensen doing,Giants
i like this pitch count,Giants
"Woah, deja vu",Giants
hold onto your butts,Giants
Yeah that‚Äôs about right,Giants
"oh wow, oh FFS, are you serious",Giants
OH FUCK OFF,Giants
You dumb greedy bitch.,Giants
why,Giants
Wow really?,Giants
Oh for real??? That was a bad move!,Giants
Bad read all the way,Giants
"Aw, fuck, why would you go for that?",Giants
Lol that's about on par with how things are going this game,Giants
Can‚Äôt make a baserunning mistake like that. Terrible. Ballgame,Giants
Oh. My. Fuck. What just happened,Giants
Can you hear me screaming into my pillow,Giants
Why do I watch baseball,Giants
Shit I‚Äôm wrong he looked safe there,Giants
SAFE,Giants
Who did the scouting report tonight?  Bad move Tauchman smh,Giants
Why the FUCK was Tauchman watching that ball before he left the box?,Giants
"He's fucking safe, yo",Giants
YES!@,Giants
"Even if he was out, that was a pretty impressive slide",Giants
you ever have a ball go right by you and then just drop dead on the spot,Giants
HE'SSAFE,Giants
TOOTBLAN?,Giants
He‚Äôs safe,Giants
He was safe,Giants
Ooooo that was close.,Giants
"Unrelated to how frustrating this game is, I just realized how atrocious Bellinger's hair is.",Giants
"well, not gonna lie‚Ä¶ closer than i thought",Giants
Bro he‚Äôs safe please NY please get it right,Giants
It's possible he's safe but that was incredibly reckless with Bellinger's arm.,Giants
He‚Äôs safe,Giants
...safe? jesus that's close,Giants
Garbage,Giants
He only looks out in the zoomed out replay. Closer view shows he's safe,Giants
"Fuck off, NY.",Giants
WTAF BULLSHIT!,Giants
That was safe,Giants
that's bullshit,Giants
Even the NY umps are fucking us today huh,Giants
Easily most brutal game of the season what the fuck,Giants
Posey pls,Giants
Fucking BULL,Giants
Posey hasn't hit one out in a bit,Giants
Bullshit.,Giants
pain,Giants
That was ugly,Giants
Game over. No way noodle bat does anything,Giants
Fuck this awful game,Giants
Night night boys,Giants
"Come on Dick, you're our only hope",Giants
Dick is due,Giants
Fuck that shit,Giants
Bleh. See you tomorrow boys,Giants
HAY NAKOOOO JUSMIO (sorry the filipino in me comes out when im upset),Giants
"He‚Äôs a huge dork but I honestly respect the way Bauer competes. I don‚Äôt hate the guy, fun to watch.",Giants
I hate this neighborhood rule of you have to keep on the plate for a long long time.  I mean they could hold the guy there for an hour and then finally get called out.  It's stupid and defies the laws of inertia.,Giants
"Oh look, RISP and we don‚Äôt do shit. I‚Äôm so surprised.",Giants
Casali needs to fucking go along with Tauchman. Absolute garbage ABs and Kapler keeps putting them in during high leverage situations where everyone knows they won‚Äôt do a damn thing.,Giants
I actually like Trevor bauer but I'm still super excited to see our boys wipe the floor with him,Giants
Max Muncy takes out a calculator when he tips,Giants
Fuck Toyota! Still supporting election instigators,Giants
Could kapler at least look mad at this BS? Where's Bochy when you need him?,Giants
"Mods, can we get a ""racist against Angel Hernandez's"" flair? Asking for a friend",Giants
Fuck toyota,Giants
Came off the bag.,Giants
"Fucking tootblan. Seriously, what a fucking moron.",Giants
Trevor Bauer's Swiss army knife only has two tools.,Giants
"Trevor Bauer prefers nachos Flanders style

"Sigh, fire up the bullpen.",Giants
I really hope we don‚Äôt face the Dodgers in the playoffs,Giants
BCraw responds here...,Giants
Almost impossible to comprehend that anything less than 100 wins is a disappointment for this Dodgers team,Giants
Bauer bro shut the fuck up,Giants
"What the hell is this?! Lol
https://imgur.com/a/1p1QQqX",Giants
"well, he tried",Giants
"Not gonna lie, the new pavilion they built outside the stadium is pretty nice and it‚Äôs finally at least comparable to every other stadium in the league.

Edit: and you don‚Äôt have to leave the stadium now to move from the infield to the outfield. üôÑ",Giants
Man our bench is so sad this year,Giants
"That run not scoring is on Wilmer not knocking it out, knowing they can‚Äôt hit with RISP",Giants
"As much as I cannot fucking stand Bauer, dude is talented.",Giants
Dick has no business even sniffing the cleanup spot. Kapler must be out of his mind putting him there.,Giants
IF HE‚ÄôS NOT SAFE MLB WANTS THE DODGERS TO WIN,Giants
He's safe but I don't trust they'll reverse the call,Giants
That‚Äôs a rule that should be changed imo - being off base for a tenth of a second on a slide should not get you out,Giants
Replay is fucking useless,Giants
I hate the Dodgers.,Giants
tauchman was safe,Giants
"#WELL THAT'S IT! SEASON'S DONE! PACK IT UP, BOYS!


/S",Giants
"I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a great guy and is good at what he does, but why is our trainer overweight?",Giants
Bunch of doomers lol. Relax its one game.,Giants
"Tauchman should of stayed at 1st. Why even risk it , what a dumbass play",Giants
THEY JUST FUCKING KICKED OUR ASS AND TAUNTED US AT THE END! FADE ME FAM,Giants
Officials gotta protect their precious dodgers,Giants
DFA Tauchman. Right after the game,Giants
Imagine having video from multiple angles and plenty of time to review it but still getting the call wrong.,Giants
https://dodgersway.com/2021/06/27/dodgers-latest-brawl-dodger-stadium-proves-team-intervene/,Giants

Does Tony still want to be T-bone?!?,Giants
Statement game for the dodgers.,Giants
Whellllllp... I am pretty tired.,Giants
"Nothing like the national league being stuck in the 80‚Äôs for potentially a good pitching hitter get 10 hits a year, so fucking weak.",Giants
0-3 with RISP,Giants
"I have this dumb idea that MLB should play 5- or 6-inning games as the routine, but make double- and triple-headers the norm. Season length = somewhere between 252 and 306 games.",Giants
Good pitch,Giants
can wotus not coach third base like a dumbass this time? especially with flores,Giants
duggar's tired out...he's not used to playing every day!,Giants
"Damn, Duggar has been so huge for us, but that strike out hurts big time. Chance to score a run went from likely to highly highly unlikely",Giants
I don‚Äôt see the giants winning this one. Hope I‚Äôm surprised,Giants
Man I just love getting runners into scoring position with less than 2 outs 3-4 times in a game and then not being able to do fuck all with it. This is fucking pathetic.,Giants
Pathetic. No plan of attack at the plate tonight.,Giants
maybe a reporter should ask gabe y no one bunts in bunting situations.,Giants
Curt Shitsali,Giants
Wow those are AAA level at bats. This is the most painful game I‚Äôve sat through this year.,Giants
Beat LA. Fuck the doyers,Giants
"0-14 what the actual fuck man‚Ä¶. 

I‚Äôll say it again and again  We cannot do that shit to be considered World Series contenders",Giants
"Wow‚Ä¶ this is complete trash, un fucking believable",Giants
I‚Äôll be content if we split the two. We‚Äôll be right where we are now.,Giants
Base running gaffe,Giants
That's it.  Packing my pitchfork and torch and hopping a flight to New York.  Anyone care to join?,Giants
Hit foot held him off that‚Äôs bullshit,Giants
"In all fairness, New York fucked the Angels pretty good last week. Call it what it is, but I didn't see anything to overturn that call last week.",Giants
DFA Tauchman,Giants
Kinda hope he just strikes/pops out the side so we can stay mad about the sham game and not go to bed thinking about that.,Giants
Those were some good pitches,Giants
well bright side we won‚Äôt go 0-13 again tmmr and we only lost by 1.,Giants
Jesus fuck pull Disco already,Giants
Yikes dawg. Disco just doesn‚Äôt have it against LA,Giants
How the fuck is this team so trash with RISP? Literally makes no sense. Double with no fucking outs‚Ä¶,Giants
"MLB has had to bite the bullet and admit the Giants are in first place, and put us at the top of their stupid power rankings. Their internal screams are incredible.

"off to the store cunts, whaddya need?",Giants
"Hardly the only one to blame, but Gabe really helped throw this one away",Giants
Honestly don‚Äôt hate the hustle,Giants
OT but Warriors moving Wiseman and Wiggins for Siakam is suprising for sure.,Giants
"Great location on a 2 strike count, you moose knuckle",Giants
Ruf is the guy I‚Äôd want up here tho. The rest of the giants bench can‚Äôt hit,Giants
"Need a bat and some middle relief, or there's gonna be no hope for this team in the playoffs",Giants
Wow fucking loser. How are these idiots hitting under 200 getting time when they run after doubles.,Giants
  Classic Fraudgers.,Giants
Stupid Tauchman!,Giants
Anyone else gonna watch the game ?,Giants
Boo yah üéâ,Giants
Every thing we‚Äôve given up we‚Äôre ahead in the count,Giants
So why can batters use glue to hold on to the bat but pitchers can't use glue to hold on to the ball?,Giants
Max Muncy wipes his ass bare handed,Giants
"81mph up in the zone x3 , then 97mph away at the ankles, and then finished Ruf with a 84mph slider down and away. nasty.",Giants
Why not ruf here?,Giants
All I want is a grand slam,Giants
I mean how long does he have to tucking stay on the bag this is bullshit,Giants
Safe,Giants
HORSE FUCKING SHIT.,Giants
WHAT THE FUCK!! PROTEST THAT SHIT!,Giants
Fuck the Dodgers,Giants
literally how,Giants
GG,Giants
"L's tis game L#1 for Kapler subbing in Casali LMAO, L#2 for Kapler for leaving Dickerson in all game LMAO",Giants
Greedy fuck,Giants
That was on Tauchman. Dumb idea to go for two. Game is fucking over if Posey can‚Äôt do something.,Giants

"Damnit Wade, somewhat unknown and becoming a multifunctional asset to the team? Gonna get Pillar‚Äôd. I miss him already",Giants

"Totally exposed as a team.

FTD.

Angry Butt highlights,Giants
jumping on first pitch fastballs...wake the fuck up,Giants

Important information: Brandon Crawford,Giants
Brandon Crawford? More like Brandon Crawllstar,Giants
So close,Giants
Hope Flores isn‚Äôt hurt,Giants
Here we go Duggy,Giants
Damn.,Giants
"that was the same strike 2 pitch last time to Duggar, needs to adjust",Giants
Oof,Giants
Just froze him and waited him out,Giants
Do sliders have vertical break? I always thought it was more horizontal,Giants
Dirty,Giants
"I love Krukow, but he doesn't understand physics too well.",Giants
That was fucking lame.,Giants
And *clench*,Giants
"Great, now the bullpen. Gotta kept it close. Not like against Oakland",Giants
How does he have a 3.91 ERA while allowing a .139 BA vs LHP and .204 vs RHP?,Giants
"Nice pitch, Garcia",Giants
Garcia looks loose,Giants
What??,Giants
Eh I don't see it.,Giants

Have they even had a runner at 3rd tonight?,Giants
RIP RISP,Giants

What an out,Giants
Dubon pinch run here or keep Flores for his bat?,Giants
Is it Tauchman? I really hope it isn't Tauchman,Giants
Cmon cmon cmon cmon,Giants

Casali magic time,Giants
Jesus Will Smith,Giants
Curt pls,Giants
Treinen has no control,Giants
"Well, at least it's Casali who does make contact. I'm somewhat ok with this",Giants
Will Smith keeping their team on his back,Giants
The next act in the redemption arc of Curt Casali!,Giants
Ohhhhhhh god that was the pitch,Giants
Hmm‚Ä¶that was the pitch to hit,Giants
So Smith is getting free drinks for a month after this game.,Giants
Def a fight going on,Giants
Oof right down the middle,Giants
"Casali L7: .429/.478/.857

totally got this",Giants
If casali is the guy who gets an RBI‚Ä¶,Giants
"WHAT

Ok nevermind. He swung.",Giants
INTERESTING swing call but at least a reminder that AH had better be at 2nd tomorrow so literally everything he does is reviewable,Giants
Of course,Giants
We getting all the bullshit calls today,Giants
FUCK,Giants
God fucking dammit,Giants
KENLEY JANSEN HAS A HEART CONDITION THAT I REALLY FEEL BAD FOR HIM ABOUT BUT HE'S A DODGER AND STILL SUCKS!,Giants
Sham game,Giants

Terrible fucking at bat,Giants
Being forced to use Casali was tough.,Giants
I thought curt had some magic left in him,Giants
Man Curt just took the juiciest pitch of this entire game so far.,Giants
You don‚Äôt even spell your name right,Giants
Awful with risp tonight,Giants
Kapler just threw the game WTF,Giants

Weird. Tauchman seemed pretty convinced,Giants
FUCKING SHIT SO CLOSE,Giants
Wasn‚Äôt even close,Giants
Ooooh fuck,Giants
He‚Äôs out. Bad base running. Edit: he‚Äôs safe!,Giants
LA is a stupid place,Giants
That bounce was some shit luck.,Giants
Safe,Giants
Oh man. Oh man. That's so disappointing. I feel ashamed for doubting your 3-1 swinging,Giants

No üòí,Giants
What a slide by Tauchman,Giants
He safe,Giants
"Damn, he might be safe, shit, I dunno",Giants
HES SAFE OMG HE HAS TO BE,Giants
"looks like he avoids the tag and his knee is touching the bag as his arm slides past it.  Looks safe

edit: welp",Giants
Ump had a tough angle; just a hard play since there were a ton of important angles.,Giants
Cant be mad at any call. So hard to tell.,Giants
Wow that‚Äôs a great slide,Giants
Oh shit... what a fucking slide!!!,Giants
He is safe,Giants

I think they might not overturn cuz he was called out. But god I hope I'm wrong,Giants

Yikes,Giants
Posey was sitting on the cutter,Giants
Game.,Giants
Pain.,Giants
Damn,Giants
Damn. Gave them a LOT of help tonight. They get this one.,Giants
This team really doesn‚Äôt deserve the 50 wins.,Giants
This team ain‚Äôt doing shit in the playoffs.,Giants
sticky ban hasnt impacted bauer,Giants
It‚Äôs funny how much y‚Äôall hate Bauer already,Giants
"I‚Äôm gonna ask this again:

# Wow, who the fuck is DeScalafani and why is he pitching? Fuck off.",Giants
"Wow, who the fuck is DeScalafani and why is he pitching?  Fuck off.",Giants
"Posey looks lost at the plate

Edit: no",Giants
Biggest L of the game so far goes to Kapler for subbing out POSEY for cassali?!/!?!?!?1?,Giants
"Giants being exposed!!

\#fake",Giants
So this DeScalafani guy can‚Äôt pitch and bunts it right back to pitcher on a force play.,Giants
wow giants broadcast sure cut away from bauer quickly‚Ä¶. just show him. talent is talent,Giants
Bauer voted for Newsom....,Giants
[deleted],Giants
1-877,Giants
What a fucking loser. Can you at least ground out to the right side of the field?,Giants
i have absolutely zero faith in garcia here,Giants
Hahahahahahhahaahha Casali is the fucking worst. Doesn‚Äôt swing at the fastball down the middle then proceeds to look like an idiot on two sliders that weren‚Äôt even close.,Giants
Fucking A,Giants
"I have a feeling that Jansen will come in and absolutely dominate. Pls be wrong, feeling",Giants
He blocked the lane.,Giants
That was dumb even if he's safe. Might be too close to overturn.,Giants
Not smart Mike. Shoulda stayed at first,Giants
Had a feeling New York wouldn't overule. Gotta protect the Umps' feelings,Giants
[Oh it's Bauer? ](https://giphy.com/gifs/movie-austin-powers-international-man-of-mystery-l1KVb2dUcmuGG4tby),Giants
Any charts on his spin rate recently? I don't feel like searching right now lol,Giants
üï∫üèº,Giants
And helped ensure some of the non-deserving Bums.,Giants
On it! Have we made any deals with an AL team subreddit yet?,Giants
Imagine games starting for me at 10:45 pm most nights out east,Giants
Personally I feel no baseball game should start before 7PM on a weekday. I just wanna get my stuff done and make dinner before the game starts,Giants
"When the Giants shifted M-Th night game starts from 7:15 to 6:45, attendance dropped. People from outside SF can't easily get there earlier, and there wasn't much increase within SF",Giants
"This reads like someone trying to hit the word limit on their essay.

Also, FTD.",Giants
"He basically admitted in the ESPN interview that they know how to get around the checks. If I were Kapler, I would pull a Girardi and make them check him mid inning.",Giants
I appreciate this take. Too much doom & gloom in this thread.,Giants
"Yup, we're doing as well as we are for a reason",Giants
Dodgers as a team are -169rpm on 4-seam average spin rate compared to June 3rd. Hope our offense can take advantage of that!,Giants
I‚Äôm here for this üß°,Giants
This would be the best news all day.,Giants
"3rd opinion coming up next, I‚Äôll be so happy if he is able to play again this season.

(Not to mention he‚Äôs been one of the best hitters in baseball over the past 2 years)",Giants
#DFA,Giants
Ruh Oh.. Angel Hernandez behind the plate??,Giants
He's in the process of being downvoted to oblivion.,Giants
Yeah seriously,Giants
Yeah he has got to go,Giants
Yes,Giants
Yes,Giants
yes,Giants
"As of next month, yes, 13",Giants
Same. Yesterday was just the worst. I still have hope for today though.,Giants

I am glad to know this ü§ó,Giants
This.,Giants
Amazing.,Giants
Hahahaahahha,Giants
you want duggar to hit .400 or something?,Giants
He just specializes in coming across as pathetic even when he gets outs,Giants
"I hate the wave.


( I love the wave)",Giants
And then the organ pipes in,Giants
Any beach balls yet? I'm outside have a cig.,Giants
During Saturday's game against the A's a bunch of people tried starting the wave in the bleachers and my partner and I (and a lot of other people) had to kindly tell them to keep that shit in LA.,Giants
I‚Äôm confused as to your stance on the wave,Giants
They weren‚Äôt already?,Giants
Their fanbase *is* tools,Giants
"‚ÄúYay.‚Äù

ANGEL NUMBERS,Giants
"Manly, so I heard",Giants
that's fucking insane,Giants
And strikeouts,Giants
Yaz always sexy fym,Giants
Yeah he‚Äôs just not making a lot of good contact lately,Giants
He has had so many popouts this season. Way more than I could ever remember for any recent Giants player tbh. That launch angle approach has its downfalls.,Giants
Going for 2nd was the right call,Giants
"Because Tauchman literally shits the bed all the time and they needed fucking base runners, not him trying to be a goddamn hero and shitting his pants like he always does. Tauchman is literally the worst.",Giants
"For those guys saying it‚Äôs not safe in the pavilion or whatever, that was not my experience at all. I was there for The Catch game on a Friday night.

I was obviously a Giants fan. I was wearing a bright orange skirt and my black jersey. I was definitely yelling and chanting. I was chanting over the Dodgers chants and people noticed. Keeping a smile on my face and interacting from a place of love (like a wholesome sibling rivalry) went really far for me.

I was actually surprised by this but I had a lot of people compliment me on their way out after the game. The couple of giants fans of course, but the number of dodger fans who gave me a nod or told me basically ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing it right‚Äù was really cool.

It‚Äôs important definitely to toe the line between ‚Äújust enough‚Äù and ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù Don‚Äôt let yourself become overly concerned to the point that you‚Äôre not having fun or not supporting our guys.

They love the rivalry just as much as we do. Read the emotions of people around you and you‚Äôll be better than okay.

And really seriously, do not underestimate the power of a smile.",Giants

"Of all the at bats in the game, that was definitely one of them.",Giants

not to mention the help he‚Äôs gotten from this blind ump too,Giants
Bau Haus is a tool bag,Giants
"True, but every game between these teams is a game 7 though.",Giants
He does do a good job playing the heel at least,Giants
We need some real cute from these bats.,Giants
We like to have fun here!,Giants

Not a hit in two days much less a homer.  What's wrong with all these other teams?,Giants
That strike 3 looked awful purty as well. Bauer is damn good tho. Let's hope the guys break the spell.,Giants

LMAO,Giants
lmaooooo,Giants
That‚Äôs good for us cause he‚Äôs been pumping us pretty hard‚Ä¶.hope the Giants are on the pill,Giants
I hate the Dodgers just as much as the next Giants fan but umm this Bauer guy knows 110% what is he doing up on that mound,Giants
Jarlin‚Äôs certainly turned things around since earlier this year. Last outing was kinda eh and he clunked against the Phillies but he‚Äôs a lot better now.,Giants
and my axe...?,Giants
"I‚Äôm fine with it too honestly, aside from Duggar our other outfielders have been pretty bad at the plate anyway",Giants
your correct with it being unpopular. hes as close to an automatic strikeout as a nonpitcher can get.,Giants
Yeah. Ending with a consonant doesn't work. At all.,Giants
He‚Äôs had more hits recently than Slater?,Giants
Who else is on the bench?,Giants
"Walk-off hit two days ago, remember?",Giants
Gabermetrics fell too in love with the memes,Giants
*two and a third he wouldn‚Äôt have had to throw if he hadn‚Äôt been fucked on a call. Agreed.,Giants
Only giving up 3 runs to the Dodgers isn‚Äôt bad at all,Giants
"Struck out 5 over 5 innings. Dealt with some shit from the ump. Gave up 3 HR - not great.

Overall, threw 86 - 51 were strikes.

Not his best, but not his worst.",Giants
Yea he is,Giants
"*I felt nothing.*

That's what Max Muncy's wife said",Giants
Felt nothing in the vague west San Jose area.,Giants
He should be demoted to ball washer.,Giants
It was hilarious when he lost his lawsuit against MLB over being denied World Series work for racial reasons.,Giants
It was probably a ball with Angel‚Äôs strike zone,Giants
He heard that you are supposed to establish the strikezone in the first inning; and didn't realize that's for pitchers not the ump.,Giants
Beyond a win,Giants
I want to subscribe to this reminder,Giants
And how,Giants
Because you're smart and have good judgement,Giants
Oh he sweatin‚Äô fa sho,Giants
MLB should be done with angel,Giants
In an 18 wheeler no less!,Giants
"I live in LA, he sure as fuck ain‚Äôt the only one

Also: he speeds up if you try to pass him.",Giants
I‚Äôm willing to forgive them given the circumstances (i.e. Wilmer being injured and swings needing to be a bit more aggressive given the Bauer zone),Giants
"Oh, that's never happening. Giants staff made it abundantly clear they weren't having any of this sticky stuff funny business. They wouldn't touch him with the Marlin's dick.",Giants

*chokes on drink*,Giants
This would not surprise me in the least,Giants
It's going to be that kind of game...,Giants
Angel Hernandez has that effect on pretty much everyone,Giants
Yeah if Bauer could not throw 115 pitches this time that‚Äôs be awesome,Giants
Let this be a lesson to you.,Giants
"Nah, you need to go take a piss every time we go to bat. Start filling up that bladder my dude",Giants

"I don‚Äôt think Kap has ever been ejected, at least not with us. Maybe in Philly but the guy just doesn‚Äôt like conflict.",Giants
Add it to the pile lmao,Giants
The sad thing is he doesn‚Äôt even know which team he‚Äôs helping or hurting. He goes out there every day without a clue how to do his job correctly.,Giants
I‚Äôm sitting in the upper deck behind home plate and they look like bullshit but I can‚Äôt be sure from up here,Giants
Is this for real?! What the fuck!,Giants
"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs that great of a player, he just always seems to have our number",Giants
They also both have good face structures. Muncy just looks like God gave up on him.,Giants
MLB probably would make more money off his public lynching than keeping him around,Giants
By firing squad.,Giants
Staked on an anthill naked midday,Giants
"This may be one of the most sarcastic comments ever!

"I was gonna say that, and the high sock look too.",Giants
:'),Giants
"He very well might not get a ""break""",Giants
"And with our luck, he'll end up on the All-Star team and get less of a break.",Giants
The last Bauer start was far more frustrating. Just fastballs down the pipe/him missing the zone with fastballs and we couldn‚Äôt do ANYTHING,Giants
Best thing you‚Äôve said all night. No moral victory tonight. Hopefully these Giants can get out there and win this fucking thing,Giants
it's been a soft combination of getting fucked by angel hernandez as well as that Bauer guy just knowing how to pitch a ball game even without his hard stuff,Giants
How could you say something so brave yet so controversial,Giants
The spiciest of ketchup takes.,Giants
we seriously do. 0-13 with RISP is a deserved loss.,Giants
True story.,Giants
"the way he was literally rolling in pain was so heartbreaking to watch, reminded me of Posey dragging himself away from the pain.

You can't sharpen a turd.,Giants
"They are occasionally suspended without pay for something really egregious, like Angel now knowing the rules one time.  But mostly they're bulletproof.",Giants
I don‚Äôt think the rules of baseball let you get an RBI hit with a runner on second or third. We would‚Äôve seen one by now if they did.,Giants
"0-10

FTFY",Giants
"If they got checked before, they could theoretically apply something during the inning.",Giants
They have to warm up and it‚Äôll take too much time factoring that in,Giants
"Yep, I was kinda surprised Krukow even brought up the possibility lol. Flores got thrown out at third on a bunt just a few innings back.",Giants
That felt like a ‚Äúfuck it let‚Äôs see what happens‚Äù move. It wasn‚Äôt even a favorable matchup.,Giants
"This.

Slater might of been struggling but I have way more trust in a guy who has more pinch hit ABs this year",Giants
Slater could at least comprehend the concept of get the ball to the outfield to give us a chance at a sac fly. Can't move runners on a strikeout...,Giants
Slater looks awful lately. At least Casali Catches shutouts.,Giants
Stupid-a-fucking game,Giants
I‚Äôd pay good money to watch that.,Giants

**WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE**,Giants
This is one of his better games of the year.,Giants
And why is is he batting cleanup?!,Giants
Will keep believing!!,Giants
"Dodger fans barely know baseball, and they boo at routine plays, like the Giants are supposed to just let them win or something. #entitled",Giants
better than the first time we played them‚Ä¶. but not like they‚Äôve been playing,Giants
Hole tender !! Lmao,Giants
Naw. Everyone is just stoked at how dialed his strike zone is,Giants
Just typical Hernandez shit,Giants
I‚Äôm only watching the box score. How do the giants have 10 hits and only 2 runs?,Giants
Would have been Tauchman if Yaz didn't get hurt.,Giants
don‚Äôt always rely on current averages‚Ä¶ because a player‚Äôs last 5 games could be a  .429 average or something which I think is what Tauchman is doing recently.,Giants
"I agree, I don't think it was a bad call. Honestly there was no one on the bench I'd want up there in that situation. He used what he had",Giants
0-13 with runners in scoring position. Fuck... I'd be more than happy if we could hit at the Mendoza line in those situations.,Giants
"Same with Dubon... In June he has TWO multi-hit games and a total of THREE extra base hits (2 doubles and 1 solo HR)... To put into perspective, Crawford's slugging % is almost the same as Dubon's OPS!",Giants

"#**2021 San Francisco Giants**

#**INFIELDERS:**

**Donnie Barrels-** Donovan Solano, normally our starting 2nd baseman. Donovan has had an interesting run here in SF, despite injuries he continues to come through when needed most.

**Dubie, Dubinator-** Current platooning infielder/outfielder Mauricio DuboÃÅn. When Dubie smiles you know good baseball is being played. This young dynamo has played all 7 positions, one can only hope we will see Dubon pitch some time. Makes about an error a game lately.

**BLET, DFA, immediately, with prejudice!-** Terms of endearment for our beloved long tenured 1st baseman Brandon Belt aka the giraffe ü¶í. **BELTED-** for when he hits or homers. **Just placed back on the IL**

**DFA- Designate For Assignment.** For when Belt fails to score 5 runs on a Grand Slam or any other superhuman failures.

**Crawdaddy, BCraw, Crawed, etc -** We have two Brandons on the team. Brandon Crawford is our long tenured Shortshop and the second half of the mighty duo ‚ÄúThe Brandons' ' Currently leading the team in RBIs (51) and home runs (16) and slaying it with the glove of which he is a clinical master. Is the owner of the most spectacular head of hair in the MLB.

**RBI - Runs Brandoned In**

**LONGO!, Longo Dongo, etc-** 3rd Baseman Evan Longoria came to the west reviving himself well beyond his contract. He‚Äôs fearless, tough and funny who‚Äôs been instrumental in helping teammates as one of the elder statesmen of the team. Currently on IL still

**Get Willy with it. Flored! *El Fuego* Flores Wilmer Flores,** our platoon infielder veteran. Sometimes he can rake it like an All-star and sometimes he can field it like a gold glover. Getting lots of innings of work due to the roster injuries and great performances at the plate.

**Thairo Estrada-** Call up from Triple A. No nicknames yet.

**Jason Vosler- Vos the Bos** 27 yr old rookie call up from Triple A. Has a pair of clutch pinch hit homers to his name already. Is starting to see more and more playing time as long as his bat is active.Currently Triple A

#**OUTFIELDERS:**

**The Duggarnaut! Steven Sluggar, Teach me how to Duggie! Duggout Catch!-**

Steven Duggar, if there was Gruden‚Äôs Grinders in the MLB his plucky motherfucker would be one of them. Day in, day out he is there helping in whatever capacity Kaplar needs him to. A typical performance includes at least one spectacular catch made to look routine, 1 extra base knock that would‚Äôve normally been a single and 1 dugout moment where he is all smiles and high fives.

**____man! https://i.imgur.com/clTX2Jc.jpg, Thiefman, Sockman, Knockman, The Platinum Sombrero man. Catchman-** when he fields a play. Walkman- when he struts to first. Splashman- when he puts it in the Bay. Tauchman the Fan favorite mid-season acquisition this year. Sadman because he is in a notoriously bad slump right now. However he did hit a bullet for a grand slam to put the Giants over the top one time and has a half dozen spectacular web gems to his name. He can‚Äôt be DFA‚Äôd lol

**Slatermannnnnn!-** Austin Slater, outfielder. Slater can sometimes be a Skater and fucking up. This tougher than your average journeyman has done his best to remain productive and engaged at the plate.

**RUF, RUF em Up, ooh that‚Äôs Ruf, etc-** Any act performed by one outfielder Darron Ruf. A gigantic beast of a man who reminds you of a junkyard dog with a name to match. When he‚Äôs on, he‚Äôs unstoppable.

**BIG DICK! Dick em down, Slick Dick, Father Napout, Old Man, etc-** Alex Dickerson, outfielder. Pretty self explanatory on this one. Came back from IL in a huge way.

**‚ÄúYAZ!‚Äù Yaslaunchski, etc-** Mike Yastrzemski, master of the launch angle when he is hot. Has a hot glove in right field and even hotter bat as of late. RIP- Yazstache

**Lamont Wade Jr.-** Hit the first lead off home run that I‚Äôve seen in a Giants game in some time. Has been a gift to the injury beleaguered Giants staff so far. Currently recalled from Triple A and immediately made an impact again with a dramatic game tying or winning hits!

#**CATCHERS:**

**BUSTED, Gerald Dempsey, Hunter Pence‚Äôs Good Friend, BUST IT! Buster Hugs-**

The indomitable Giants Catcher known as Buster Posey. Whenever he dead eye snipes a runner to 2nd the sub goes ballistic. Buster has been a single making machine lately hitting for a high average the likes of which won him MVP back in 2012. It has been great to see his resurgence. Known also as one hell of a hugger. The good friend reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp8YGYU3i1s

**Big Cas-** Catcher Casali has been heating up at the plate.  Could we be seeing a hero‚Äôs redemption arc in the making? Stay tuned!

#**PITCHERS:**

**GAS MAN-** Kevin Gausman‚Äôs resurgence to the forefront of the MLB pitching world has been a head scratcher for MLB Pundits who would see this swing and miss filth flinger tailspinning like his backfoot slider into the dirt and his ERA rising into oblivion. However this Giants Ace has held his own. Taking to the mound with all the confidence of an All-Star and leader of the Giant‚Äôs pitching staff.

**GOOD WOOD!-** And all other Wood jokes can be directed towards Alex Wood. He can be elusive, filthy and a genuine pleasure to watch carve up batters week to week so far this season but hasn‚Äôt had a dominate outing in a few weeks recently. 

**DISCO!-** Anthony DeSclafani. Right handed pitcher who is killing batters lately with his fantastic pitches on the mound. DisCGSO- For when he completes the 9 inning shutout.

**Sammy Long-** Triple A call up to the regular rotation. Has a wicked curve and can dial up a nasty set of pitches. This 25 yr old ‚Äúrookie‚Äù got his first win!

**SUBMAN!-** Submariner pitcher Tyler Rogers. A closer/setup man, with a whipping noodle of a right arm he slings filth to the befuddlement of all who oppose him.

**McGeekster the Fastball Man-** Jake Mcgee our closer/setup man. Leader in club saves he will make you pray for the bravado of Brian Wilson or the elusiveness of Rob Nen when you see one of his hangers go up into the air for a LONG fly out. He should come with a clench warning whenever he takes the mound.

**Spicy Jarlin Garc√≠a-** Been on a streak of holds recently. Seems to work better after giving up a double tho to make things interesting. Has been a great setup man during the bullpen 1,2,3 punch with Rogers and McGee.

**Conner Menez- Baby Red Beard** is back on the Giants fan‚Äôs radar. However he is so hot and cold that he is leaving everyone divided. Currently at Triple A again.

**LIT HIM UP!, FEAR the Red Beard-** Zack Littell is another setup arm in the Giants bullpen. Good outings have Giants fans singing his praises, bad outings will have fans scratching their heads.

**Shimmy Shimmy Cue Cue Puff-**

Johnny Cueto, our former GIants ace pitcher and big time pitching acquisition post the dynasty era. Has been often injured, often brilliant and dominant. Recently however he made his first quality start of the year without getting shelled. I do not know what his future will hold or if he is truly on the downslide of his career.

**Jos√© √Ålvarez-** No nicknames yet.

**Dominic Leone-** No nicknames yet.

**Jimmie Sherfy the Sheriff** The Long Arm of the Bullpen Law",Giants

Man I was so confused that two people commented about this with the words ‚Äúhog-wild‚Äù in both subs at the same time and had to check the usernames to make sure I wasn‚Äôt just seeing stuff.,Giants
"I expect a couple marquee signings, plus the Posey option and a Gausman extension. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre gonna shoot their wad all in one offseason. 

The goal is long term financial flexibility that allows you to make the right move at the right time. I expect the bigger signings will come to accompany the arrival of top prospects like Luciano, Ramos, Harrison, Matos, Bart.",Giants
"Oh to seriously answer, I think I Zaidi is hesitant to make any big splash deals until he thinks the farm and supporting cast would sustain big players.

Yeah that's the ugly truth about Duggar's season IMO. His hitting will most likely be coming back to earth - that babip is unreal hahaha.,Giants
He just needs a reason to hit the afterburners and rip,Giants

thats my main worry for the team. its like a nba team winning a lot relying on the 3 ball to win. for the giants its the hr. sometime in the future they will regress to the mean.,Giants
The scene today at MLB at front office when word got out that the Giants had been placed in the number one power rankings spot: https://youtu.be/Y6THG0MIqmc?t=21,Giants
Yeah .234 with 6 home runs is unacceptable when you‚Äôre already a bad defender and baserunner,Giants
Wtf man,Giants
"Let‚Äôs not go there, please",Giants
A DUGGARNAUT launch,Giants
Coots Light and Flamin Hot Cheetos please and thank you.,Giants
"I haven't been watching the entire game, how so?",Giants
Please. Down by 1 in the 9. You better be 100%. This ain‚Äôt no hustle participation trophy.,Giants
That's just a rumor. There is nothing likely to happen anytime soon,Giants
No way the move Wiggins. I think he needs to be there starter in the 2nd quarter. Get that 2nd team locked in.,Giants
"Considering how firmly the owner has said any trade for Wiseman would have to be huge, and how much curry and kerr and draymond love playing with wiggins, I really doubt that.",Giants
"No fuckin way, I missed karaoke to watch the walkoff last week, I‚Äôm not missing bingo now too",Giants
"Nah, I‚Äôm real busy weeknights during baseball season‚Ä¶",Giants
He already PH,Giants
Already used him,Giants
All I want is 1 run,Giants
Until the tag is not on him? lmao,Giants
Until time is called by the ump if that ever happens. I could see them changing the rule at some point,Giants
"Did you watch the full replay?  Initially safe, but came off the bag.",Giants
Never really understood why people hop in game threads and say shit like this,Giants
You!,Giants
Jansen could still blow it,Giants
can the mods fucking ban this idiot?,Giants
Literally one bad game,Giants
"A first place team, in case the news isn't getting to your part of the world.",Giants
It‚Äôs the first fucking inning jesus what kinda fan are you,Giants
Eeyore confirmed. https://i.imgur.com/rt7QUPz.png,Giants
"My condolences to people who know you in real life, you must be a *joy* to be around.",Giants
It‚Äôs ok I almost forgot the foul ball rule too,Giants
Spun foul,Giants
Not really,Giants
Uhhhhh,Giants
Has to get passed the base,Giants
Didn't go past the base,Giants
Lol,Giants
I was tripping too dont worry was like wtf fair,Giants
Eeeeeeeyuuuuu!,Giants
Seriously though. Can DHS make someone disappear?,Giants
"Yes, down and away from the pitching hand. More outside than a curve. Less vertical than a curve. Faster than a curve typically",Giants
Everything has vertical break to some extent.,Giants
"You talking about his estimates of how high a ball his off the wall? He's a lot closer than you think, and he's always conservative with the assessment.",Giants
Have you seen the staff he‚Äôs rockin‚Äô? He‚Äôs the all-knowing wizard of China Basin,Giants
He went to the ivy league of the west coast üòÇ,Giants
Had a couple bad outings to start the year,Giants
üí™üí™üí™,Giants
Maybe he‚Äôs a boxing fan lol,Giants
"I‚Äôll take it, as long as he scores.",Giants
Seriously. Let one go,Giants
Because Dubon or Slater would‚Äôve been the much better choice.,Giants
"I think Zaidi waits to see what offers are thrown out first in the offseason to see what the spending will look like. Rizzo is a FA who could fill 1B with injury prone Belt. I don't think we should go after Scherzer, Grienke, or Kershaw tho.",Giants
Me too. A guy was complaining on Saturday because he came in in the 6th instead of Rogers. Some fucking baseball fans üôÑ,Giants
Careful. The Pope is sitting behind home plate.,Giants
"nup, gotta wait for them to maybe put them up as highlight videos...

Sometimes they forget to cut, and you get a bit of the post game show",Giants
No,Giants
Ofcourse he tried for 2,Giants
Hold Up. Wait A Minute. Something aint right....,Giants
On second thought‚Ä¶..,Giants
Both,Giants
Love.,Giants
What are you talking about we are playing tough. Not everything goes your way.,Giants
serious? fuck off,Giants
lmao. it is June and we have the best record in MLB. lighten up,Giants
It has his ERA is higher,Giants
"Yeah, it's just a coincidence  that he suddenly has no velocity.",Giants
He also out and out said the enforcement is easy to circumvent.,Giants
"> hasnt impacted bauer

Sure, that huge drop in his spin rate is due to, ummm, humidity, or something.",Giants
You mean the way Dodgers fans hated Bumgarner with a burning passion?  LOL.,Giants
Username **does not** check out,Giants
Maybe cuz of his 2.97 ERA,Giants
"#**Who the fuck are you and why are you speaking?**

#**FUCK OFF**",Giants
You looked like a clown both times you posted this.,Giants
Lost about the strikezone,Giants
Well don't you feel silly?,Giants
You'd be lost too if you got called out on a ball 6 inches off the plate.,Giants
Posey is still catching?,Giants
Pretty sure Casali was just used as a pinch hitter...,Giants
Casali was pinch hitting for the pitcher's spot. Buster is still in the game.,Giants
Casali was a pinch hitter for the pitchers spot. Cmon,Giants
Casali hit for the pitcher,Giants
Posey will probably sit tomorrow,Giants
I have good news for you,Giants
Go back to your own sub,Giants
"This guy‚Äôs a Padres fan, he‚Äôs probably playing both sides so he always comes out on top.",Giants
Are you talking like this from 3rd place? For real?,Giants
why are you here?,Giants
nah he can pitch just not very well tonight,Giants
Terrible take LOL,Giants
Do you realize that he‚Äôs 8-2 with a 2.88 ERA?,Giants
Is it bargain-basement troll night?,Giants
Attention whore is an attention whore.,Giants
he‚Äôs just an attention whore,Giants
"This is the Dodgers video feed though...you can tell because later Kruk and Miller said ""but they won't show us the foul ball""",Giants
C'mon dude.,Giants
"Let‚Äôs leave politics out of it, we can all bond over a love of Giants baseball.",Giants
"> Bauer voted for Newsom

Given his actual political views, this is unlikely.",Giants
He‚Äôs literally 8-2. Calm down.,Giants
Huh? Giving up runs happens.,Giants
You are bad and you should feel bad.,Giants
Don't you fucking dare.,Giants
I regret that I only have 1 downvote to give...,Giants
God dammit that song was on KNBR this morning as I pulled into work. I was 10 minutes late because of it.,Giants
that would probably be a dp lol,Giants
Down bad,Giants
"https://i.redd.it/jz7nhils7p371.jpg

Down 220-330 RPM on his spinning pitches.",Giants
I say Red Sox since they have a bunch of guys on there and would probably want to see Yaz,Giants
"lord, i wouldn‚Äôt have a reason to live in that case.",Giants
ahh that totally makes sense.,Giants
"Yeah except they lied, it‚Äôs not M-Th it‚Äôs always 6:45 now even on Friday and Saturday. This past weekend was the one exception but look at the remaining schedule not a single 7 o‚Äôclock game",Giants
Lol or old Twitter,Giants
You put *snot* on the ball?,Giants
Spider Tack on the Cup. Always Adjust your cup after every pitch. Bam Spin Rate while being undetected unless they check your underwear on live TV.,Giants
Peeps just don't wanna see it end...,Giants
funny how that works out as soon as an announced emphasis on cheating...,Giants
Designate For rehAb instead of surgery,Giants
#A,Giants
Dodgers played Journey at the game yesterday. I was not entertained.,Giants
Exactly.,Giants
"It's not great wine, Woodbridge, but Lodi has some great wines now. The specialty is old vine Zins, but they overall have some good stuff. Michael/David is a good one, and so is Oak Ridge (of OZV fame).

I grew up in Lodi. Can you tell? LOL",Giants
yes please,Giants
The wave is stupid. #FACT,Giants
The single worst organist in all of MLB.,Giants
Not as of yet. But you know they fukken want to.,Giants
FTD and their fucking bleacher beach balls,Giants
"The Wave actually started in Oakland, and that's the main reason Giants fans don't do it. Dodgers are just copycats.",Giants
I am against the Wave.,Giants
good point,Giants
Tools are useful. They are more like that extra few screws or washer you get after putting something together from IKEA.,Giants
Craw HR doing it for me too right now. üòç,Giants
"We‚Äôve had baserunners all game, what the team needed to do was be able to convert. And when you‚Äôre hitting as badly as 0-13 with RISP, I‚Äôm fine with trying to get an extra base when you can get it",Giants
"I‚Äôm by the first baseline tonight. Never worn giants gear to Chavez before, but I gotta show my Angelino nephew what‚Äôs up. I‚Äôll admit I am a little nervous üò¨üò¨",Giants
I think that's where we are sitting. Shit.,Giants
At the 5 hour mark! Fuck Justin Turner!,Giants
Good response indeed!,Giants
I‚Äôll bet the calls favor LA for at least 1 run when we get the ump scorecard.,Giants
Haha I posted that earlier! He looks like Kaepora Gaebora!,Giants
"Gotta be honest, I'm a little disappointed now",Giants
"I didn't call it; but it feels almost that good.

I love that kid; he's such a pro.",Giants
"Thanks, that chief of police in Dexter. Whatever her name was.",Giants
HAH! I LOVE IT!,Giants
Not with that samurai sword he doesn't! It isn't even signed by Randy Jackson!,Giants
Doesn‚Äôt excuse the theatrics. There are pitchers out there much better than him who aren‚Äôt so self-aggrandizing.,Giants
This is pretty much the story of our bullpen over the last month,Giants
Yeah I also saw him strike out 4 straight times before that,Giants
Ouch.,Giants
üòÇü•≤,Giants
"I don't want him anywhere near..., well you know what I mean.",Giants
AMEN!,Giants
‚Ä¶.And the d-backs pushing?,Giants
"Did you know that the June full moon is called the ""strawberry moon""?",Giants
"Really gonna have to disagree with ya there. 3.25 ERA, and on pace to strikeout 250, and only walk 30. His WHIP is under 1 as well. I guess when your highs rival Koufax though, it's a high bar to clear for yourself.",Giants
"He does start to break down when he gets around 80, though.",Giants
It‚Äôs about damn time. Guys are getting at bats taken away.,Giants
"Yeah, he said it was because they were racist.",Giants
"https://amp.kansascity.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/for-petes-sake/article251181714.html

This goes through some of his infamous exploits. I actually don't think it was a memo but part of the evidence in his discrimination lawsuit against MLB.",Giants
LMFAO yeah both of the other two are pretty good looking dudes. Can‚Äôt say the same for ol Max,Giants
I like this one,Giants
Considering how average he has been this year I hope he doesn‚Äôt get voted in hahaha. Give the man his rest!,Giants
"He needs to burn a fatty after the game tonight and do some soul searching.  Or, Maybe some mushies and go full-on vision quest lol",Giants
"I forgot about that one. I don't want to remember that NFCCG ever again, thanks.",Giants
"They‚Äôre good. I mean, it‚Äôs a hot dog. At least they wrap em in bacon and throw jalape√±os on if you find the right stand.",Giants
Thanks chief,Giants
im protecting myself from disappointment,Giants
I did. I actually have one for all the main HR hitters.,Giants
^(EXCEPT WHEN IT BENEFITS US),Giants
He fucking sucks.,Giants
Lol,Giants
üòÇ,Giants
even worse,Giants
Would that not be noticeable?,Giants
I'm a little light this month.,Giants
I'd pay good money to tickle him while you hold him so he doesn't see the punch coming.,Giants
Just surprising to me.,Giants
Lol no buy GameStop,Giants
"bro i held the bag for amc from the initial squeeze for 3-4 months. was down like 60% at one point. sold it all when it hit 20. 

i now have an irrational hatred towards amc even when i drive by it at the mall",Giants
"I disagree, I think the rivalry has gotten a little stale since bumgarner and puig are gone so I fully welcome new blood into the feud",Giants
√Ångel Hern√°ndez studied for a blood test and failed.,Giants
I don't even know why I chose Modesto lol,Giants
"Totally, it's the Dodgers and Muncy always kills us. Hopefully we can come back!",Giants
Absolutely. The Crawford family has had a brick in front of Oracle Park since the time when Brandon was in grade school. They have always been huge Giants fans.,Giants
"Nope, they're literally playing inside Mt Doom right now",Giants

Well that's just embarassing.,Giants
And the glasses,Giants
Thinking out loud there? Hehe,Giants
First pitch home run I think?,Giants
Dodger fans hardly know who is on their team,Giants
They also spend the whole game doing the wave or looking at their phones,Giants
I‚Äôm watching on TV and would like an answer too.,Giants
"Yeah, about that...",Giants
He‚Äôs 1-16 with 8 K‚Äôs.,Giants

"Angel Hernandez, Rob Drake, Ron Kulpa",Giants
He has the rare distinction of being suspended on one occasion for not knowing the rules.  That takes a special kind of incompetence and arrogance.,Giants
Toyota got caught donating money to the insurrectionists.,Giants
"They've been giving donations to election certification objectors, and Q nuts.",Giants
Toyota was found to have been donating the most to members of Congress who objected the 2020 election since January 6th. They even released a statement after the report came out ‚Äú We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification‚Äù,Giants

Yeah that dude was swinging outta his shoes,Giants
Stay classy LA,Giants
"they couldn't handle Donald Trump being ranked #2 out of 2

why would they be able to handle this",Giants
"I saw that one too, and wondered if by ""barely winning"" they meant they are winning games by 1 or 2 runs, instead of saying the Giants are winning a lot of games. I don't know but if this is ""barely winning"" I'll take it any day of the week.",Giants
But can you prooooove intent?,Giants
"That one was bad, no doubt. But, I or you, or most fans shouldn't know the name of an Umpire. And, we know this fucking guy. he's going to be absolute shit.",Giants
"Just bought my first Cream and I might have to get it tailored. I want one of each. The Black looks so dope too.

To be honest I don't like the logo on the black, but everything else is solid.",Giants
Good point. I still hate him lol,Giants
I did enjoy getting rid of stuff and starting fresh so to speak. Just had to blast through the chaos and leg cramps haha,Giants
Thanks and congrats to you too dude haha. Glad someone else made it through that and lived to tell the tale üòÇ,Giants
Thanks dude!,Giants
Yeah they do,Giants
Angel blowing the HBP call,Giants
I like the way you think... So long as its the Giants scoring,Giants
That's one of our edges.,Giants
I have a hard time ragging on Mookie too much. https://youtu.be/-RG0RGKBAkw,Giants
And one of them is primer,Giants
"Well that‚Äôs depressing‚Ä¶

Kinda unrelated, but especially sad when someone like Matt Olson doesn‚Äôt even make the final cut!",Giants

"seager is terrible, tell zaidi not to go after him",Giants
True,Giants
The excuse is probably because july in Arizona is hotter than the surface of Mars. But the 4th should always be a day game regardless.,Giants
Poopy butts,Giants
"Definitely, but I still think he is a better hitter than he has been his career. Looks like they‚Äôve adjusted his swing and there‚Äôs been some positive changes in some peripherals like launch angle and barrels. Hope he keeps it up",Giants
YES KING REFERENCE OF THE YEAR,Giants
idk man anything would've been good,Giants
Cole maybe? People noted yesterday that now Cole can't use Spider Tack his pitches have been more hittable. Like a curveball that with Spider Tack would drop off the table is now landing in a hitter's power zone without Spider Tack.,Giants
"Dodger fan in peace here, definitely feel that way about you guys. Scary af",Giants
That's why you have ears lol,Giants
Nope and we've had our fair share of horrible game-changing calls go against us too. Think it's been shit across baseball. Super frustrating when we have the technology to get a correct call every pitch but don't implement cause mah baseball historical or whatever,Giants
"He's such a fun anti-hero to watch. Love him or hate him, he's good for the game. His vlogs have been one of my favorite parts of this season.",Giants

Exactly,Giants
Using a blinker doesn‚Äôt even cross his mind.,Giants
Y‚Äôall walked off and I walked out of the park in shame lmao,Giants
Oh for sure. My buddy had asked me when we were there what year it opened and we said the same thing. It‚Äôs got plenty of time left and I want to go back when the Dodgers are in town.,Giants

Rip,Giants
Well that's no surprise,Giants
"I figured as much, it makes my lungs feel weird just watching‚Ä¶",Giants
Yeah you're right. WIth Belt vs righties and Slater vs lefties,Giants
"I decided to do a search of SLG on pitches high in the zone and it‚Äôs a wild ride. 

Slater - .889

Longoria - .679

Dubon (???)- .526

Yastrzemski - .472

Tauchman is somehow 8th, above posey and donnie. Darin Ruf at .091.",Giants
THISüòÖ,Giants
Jesus Christ not it‚Äôs not lmao.,Giants
Just like Saturday,Giants
"I just don't really understand why high fastballs give him issues. Alot of lefties hit the inside pitch poorly, it's common. But I would think w/ his flat swing that pitch would be pretty good for him",Giants

i'd rather he get more at bats seeing that he is the best hitter at the moment,Giants
It's a gift and a curse,Giants
You‚Äôre right. Tauchman‚Äôs been a huge fucking asset to the team and hasn‚Äôt consistently hurt them throughout his tenure here. He‚Äôs just been absolutely tits and I‚Äôm totally wrong about him.,Giants

Togo's was epic in the 1970s,Giants
It was nasty. It just hurt to watch him take it when it caught so much plate.,Giants
"People miss the first two getting to Dodgers stadium, and the final 2 because they go home crying or something? :)",Giants

He had some missed command though,Giants

"I sometimes do as well, but Max Muncy has a TI-89 Titanium(tm) he keeps in his bag to pull out whenever he wants to calculate tip.",Giants

Good point üòÇ,Giants
I need this in my life.,Giants
Supporting insurrectionists.,Giants
They continue to support Republicans that deny the legitimacy of the United States election that I voted in. So many others besides. Fuck Toyota!,Giants
I'm OOTL on this as well.,Giants
Yeah but also imagine losing to them to lose the pennant. Then also think about how we‚Äôve played against them this year,Giants
"They just read off the script, don't expect them to know what they're talking about.",Giants

you right my bad,Giants
I was referring to the distance long home runs are hit to center field versus down the line.,Giants
Thanks. I will look around.,Giants
"No kidding, what a bunch of whiny bitches.",Giants
it impacts spin and movement more than velo. Even if you have to throw harder to release a sticky baseball,Giants

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs all on Tauchman. Our inability to do anything offensively that isn‚Äôt a home run has been the biggest thorn in our side this season besides the bullpen. Tauchman just constantly shits the bed and my patience for it is long gone.,Giants
"You‚Äôll be fine. I go to several games a year and I always wear my Giants gear. Never once had a problem.

So you wouldn't kick him out of ~~bed~~ the lineup,Giants
"This is...*literally* objectively measurable.

I have to confess that I hope he gets a break.,Giants
Throw in some DMT and really talk to God.,Giants
"I feel ya there. Still can't believe the refs didn't call a fumble recovered by Bowman on that play, then the popcorn being thrown at him by Seattle fans. I'd say that one play was the darkest moment of the Harbaugh era.",Giants

What's the over/under on Kenley allowing a baserunner?,Dodgers
"Remember, kenley normally walks 1-2 batters before warming up",Dodgers
You CANT walk the leadoff guy in this situation. Or let him reach at all.,Dodgers
why am I already *clenched*,Dodgers
Whatever Kenley is trying to throw it's not fucking working,Dodgers
Must be nice to get clean innings‚Ä¶,Dodgers
I'm scared,Dodgers
Oh please don't walk the dude hitting .172,Dodgers
Jansen making us nervous right now‚Ä¶.,Dodgers
Throw strikes big fella,Dodgers
Please please don't walk him for Posey.,Dodgers
Fuck Mike Tauchman,Dodgers

Why even go to the phone lol. This is an auto-challenge. It‚Äôs the 9th inning,Dodgers

"Hopefully Bauer looks better than Gerrit Cole without the sticky, stupid ass Yankees",Dodgers
Bauer gives up way too many home runs for a dude we're paying like 40M a year smh,Dodgers
[removed],Dodgers
"Is Bauer clearly worse without sticky stuff?

Edit: LOL k guess not",Dodgers
It‚Äôs so stupid that in 2021 pitchers have to hit,Dodgers
Lol. Bauer getting tagged,Dodgers
Cleavinger >>> Victor,Dodgers
No sticky not enough breaky,Dodgers
[deleted],Dodgers
i am guessing vagiants would use posey as a dh if that comes to the nl since he cant be everyday at his  age right,Dodgers
Does he watch his own games afterwards? Does he know he's this bad at his job?? Annnnyway.....LFG FTA FTG,Dodgers
Just pray that angel is bad on them more than us,Dodgers

I‚Äôm sick,Dodgers
Holy shit a 96 fastball down the pipe. yikes,Dodgers
Uhm.. we're gonna need a walk off at this point. We're on the Jansen rollercoaster.,Dodgers
"Dude, seriously. That was fucking epic.",Dodgers
Love Posey walking away before he was actually rung up too!,Dodgers
"Girls are temporary, Muncy bombs are forever",Dodgers
It‚Äôll pass dude. It always does.,Dodgers

Hey! I don‚Äôt like your style but I can‚Äôt dispute your results.,Dodgers
Wtf it worked!!,Dodgers
Do Gavin,Dodgers
Against the leading MLB team,Dodgers
Anything less than a perfect game is considered a hangable offense according to this sub,Dodgers
It‚Äôs pretty dominant,Dodgers
üíô,Dodgers
I love Boston,Dodgers
"I mean I'd rather take a Covid ring or ""1/3"" of a ring than no ring at all. If we lose to the Rays they count that as a 100% loss. So fuck em.",Dodgers
or my personal target of ire: the ‚Äúmickey mouse‚Äù ring üôÑ,Dodgers
"Honestly the first time I‚Äôve heard of that, and I wouldn‚Äôt dare say that about the Lakers (I‚Äôm a fan, so I wouldn‚Äôt anyway), or the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, or the Tampa Bay Lightning.",Dodgers
"Agreed, although they deserved and earnt that ring",Dodgers
I don‚Äôt understand the logic. Every team played the same amount of games. How did The Dodgers have a bigger advantage compared to anyone else??,Dodgers
The only people saying that are salty ass bitches. Every team had the same conditions we did plus we had to go through an extra round we normally wouldnt have had,Dodgers
"Covid was a 60 game season. You didn‚Äôt have time to go on bad streaks. The nlcs was brutal. The World Series at a neutral site. It was the most challenging season ever. And not to mention all the off the field shit. Testing everyday, stuck in ur hotel room when U were on the road. Away from ur family all season‚Ä¶..",Dodgers
Fucking seriously. I was listening to KNBR today and they said ‚Äúthe reigning champs with an asterisk‚Äù. Went off in my car,Dodgers
"Always here to talk dodger baseball, and everything else in between. Much love!",Dodgers
Same!! None of my friends watch every day so this sub and the game chats are great,Dodgers

Maybe try a quad cheeseburger,Dodgers
Sorry man looks like we gotta sacrifice your arteries,Dodgers
ayo lemme get one of them cheese burgs thanks,Dodgers
Keep grillin‚Äô em.,Dodgers
"You better add some cheese to that, make it a quadruple",Dodgers
"it's what the great vets do. 

just like Kersh, doesn't have the FB velocity, so just mastered the slider and made it arguably the best pitch in baseball",Dodgers
*I WAS JUST GONNA SAY*,Dodgers
I‚Äôm sorry you had to discover this,Dodgers
Welcome! You'll find out it's a little bit of a roller coaster ride we tend to vent our frustrations as well as cheer our favorite Dodgers.,Dodgers

Welcome!,Dodgers
People will jump on anything they can to criticize their own team lmao,Dodgers
he boomed us...,Dodgers
Wtf true,Dodgers
yes pls,Dodgers
Fair,Dodgers

"He has bad legs, the guy doesn‚Äôt want to mess his hammy for the millionth time",Dodgers
That‚Äôs exactly what I was thinking on god üòÇüòÇ,Dodgers
What are the odds!,Dodgers
Can we wait until he gets out of this jam first? I do my shit talking mid inning lol,Dodgers
Yeah when you see a guy like Duggar hitting .326 it‚Äôs hard not to think that,Dodgers
U mean they‚Äôre not a .750 team?,Dodgers
Yup the Giants will fall off and we'll catch our stride,Dodgers
check the substance for substances,Dodgers
"So, we got another Kershaw.",Dodgers

Did someone mention fish tacos?,Dodgers
"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre winning boys, no need to try now‚Äù",Dodgers
Any day now then,Dodgers
I think we got him from the twins before the season. Wasn‚Äôt highly ranked or anything. The giants staff just seems to make random players good.,Dodgers
Not really. Was the Giants 28th ranked prospect by Fangraphs,Dodgers
Same,Dodgers
Cause he let off the hustle halfway to the plate,Dodgers
i feel that,Dodgers
Spoiler. They are,Dodgers
But what's the cost?,Dodgers
"Buy one run, get one free deal",Dodgers
"Why do we feel like this every game, about everything ?",Dodgers
same,Dodgers
Strong umpire's union plus he played the race card.,Dodgers

Kamala Harris suspends Joe Kelly 8 games for marijuana possession,Dodgers

he was cheating? how so?,Dodgers
"> Cody juice

*giggles*",Dodgers
Can‚Äôt stand Contreras but yeah. Our catchers could learn a thing or 2. The stolen bases are getting ridiculous,Dodgers
He‚Äôs just slow and doesn‚Äôt make good reads,Dodgers
He‚Äôs slow and he‚Äôs got glass bones.  Terrible defensive baseball player.,Dodgers
If only.. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,Dodgers

Jesus take my fastball,Dodgers
Erase the padres out,Dodgers
I respect your opinion tbh,Dodgers
üí£üí£üí£,Dodgers
That‚Äôs cause TB is on pitch 110+ by that time. I know he knows what he‚Äôs doing but he‚Äôs gotta figure out how to lower that pitch count.,Dodgers
Perfect practice for October,Dodgers
"Damn, imagine if all of Prior's mound visits were actually just bringing out a screenshot of the current state of the r/dodgers game chat",Dodgers

not against a RHP,Dodgers
"Wish we did the same, we barely play hard",Dodgers
There was a link in the bio of his Instagram,Dodgers
Same here.  The only place I have heard it is on this sub,Dodgers
He once posted conspiracy election to his insta and has a link to the mypillow guy there too,Dodgers
His Instagram,Dodgers
Yeah that‚Äôs what happened,Dodgers
Is that 2/4 now? I missed your guesses lol,Dodgers
Yeah that was funny! I think that guy felt like Mookie would benefit from his encouragement or something.,Dodgers
good one,Dodgers
Oh how I wish he also had the name Mark somewhere in there,Dodgers
"totally ignored all the AL picks for the ballot i cast today, i won‚Äôt make that mistake again",Dodgers

I think there are die hard Giants fans who can‚Äôt believe it.,Dodgers
Ha,Dodgers
Pics pls,Dodgers
I demand photos.,Dodgers
In the third inning?? doggo needs to pace himself!,Dodgers
it‚Äôs alright. you‚Äôre still cool in our books pineappledildos,Dodgers
Well that‚Äôs just because you haven‚Äôt been in a good one,Dodgers
I love it as long as our pitcher isn't trying to get out of a jam... which is when it tends to happen,Dodgers
"I like him, don't care if he's a Giant. Dude isn't a dick and is a great ball player. FTG though.",Dodgers
"I would agree with this, but I'm going to have to opt out.",Dodgers
He has a great baseball name,Dodgers
No way he hit him,Dodgers
"Joe Davis seriously could be the GOAT...

I know that's a wild take, but the dude will be doing the WS and Super Bowl when Joe Buck retires.

He'll have so many legendary calls",Dodgers
They want to be us so bad.,Dodgers
We‚Äôd be screwed without him,Dodgers
I'm guilty of giving him shit for his catching work but he did the damn job that inning,Dodgers
Mookie juggles nuts?,Dodgers
"Nah he was out. Great game tonight. The game thread overwhelmingly agreed he beat the tag but came off the base. Super competitive game, looking forward to tomorrow!",Dodgers
"I‚Äôll be there, can‚Äôt wait to check out the bullpen bar",Dodgers
Yeah for sure buddy,Dodgers
me too. i like it a lot,Dodgers
I see some of that ugly orange sprinkled in our stadium not too much tho.,Dodgers
I actually really can‚Äôt stand the Padres announcers. I‚Äôd rather listen to the Giants guys.,Dodgers
Yo,Dodgers
stunning!,Dodgers
I mean probably not unless he starts hitting .300. Hitting .240 with low liner singles isn‚Äôt ideal,Dodgers
NUCKING FUTS,Dodgers
Leads the NL I think,Dodgers
Oh I thought for sure he‚Äôd be leadinf,Dodgers
He‚Äôs supporting JT?,Dodgers
Needs a burger obviously /s,Dodgers
And not trying to pull it‚Ä¶.,Dodgers
"are you sure it's blaQ? how do you know it's not a green screen, and the real blaQ will come back in like 2 months?",Dodgers
GG defense it seems like,Dodgers
I‚Äôd chalk it up to a bad hop with a lot of spin IMO,Dodgers

I would love him to do this,Dodgers
Well they play the diamondbacks after us so I wouldn‚Äôt count on it lol,Dodgers
Nah that‚Äôs just the giants stink cloud,Dodgers
Hoping for some rain (after the game of course),Dodgers
lmaoooooo,Dodgers
Thank you for the insight Kenny,Dodgers
I hope Mom doesn't bust in while I'm watching filth.,Dodgers
The 2nd one got me too. Good news is it didnt last too long!,Dodgers
2nd one gets most people. I had a mild fever the next day and was essentially back to normal the day after that even though being slightly clammy,Dodgers
Smh I vote for him every day 5 times the rest of you need to pick up the slack üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª,Dodgers
Have you seen the numbers Posey is putting up?,Dodgers
Grandson,Dodgers
He wasnt a top prospect and was actually let go by the Orioles. Giants gave him a chance and hes taken off,Dodgers
It's on the baseball.theater page for some reason,Dodgers
Just not seager,Dodgers
Dodgers likewise have basically no long term commits outside of Mookie,Dodgers
That‚Äôs because we are,Dodgers
"Maybe ""A Boy Named Sue""?",Dodgers
"""Punch Fight Fuck"" - Hank 3",Dodgers
I'm not sure she had attended a Dodger game prior to her start with us.,Dodgers
victor will most likely get rocked if he‚Äôs put in :/,Dodgers
"Jimmy last time was weird man, zero control",Dodgers
Only go one way,Dodgers
"His ""regression"" is massively overstated. He still posted a .900 OPS in the 2nd half",Dodgers
Definitely. Seager and Buehler have to take priority.,Dodgers
"If you‚Äôre holding your breath for Belli to hit over .300 again, you‚Äôre going to die",Dodgers
I agree 100%,Dodgers
"me too, i just prefer them to not fall into a fielder‚Äôs glove",Dodgers
Small ball,Dodgers
Lmao,Dodgers
CALLED IT,Dodgers
I would never be seen again if that was me,Dodgers
We can hold each other.,Dodgers
"I mean, you see Baez avoid tags all the time. You're taught to put the glove down and leave it there. A good swim move like that will beat it.",Dodgers
slider is a breaking ball,Dodgers
Queen,Dodgers
Ever since Belli has been back Mooks has been performing better so I think your right,Dodgers
He needed a vegan belli brownie,Dodgers
Dude looks like he's getting smaller though lmao. Not good for the grind of an mlb season.,Dodgers
"Honestly have no clue how Lux got that many votes, he's not that popular I thought?",Dodgers
We‚Äôre still on top even if they don‚Äôt like it,Dodgers
Dodgers are something like 43-3 or 2.. when they have a lead after 7 innings. So I feel confident we can hold them.,Dodgers
The giants are like 41-2 when they have the lead after the 7th inning. So‚Ä¶. Basically both teams have pretty good bullpens‚Ä¶.,Dodgers
Is that why i saw all the syringes in the street on my trip to SF? Were they testing right under our noses?,Dodgers
good god‚Ä¶.. it all makes sense now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,Dodgers
I‚Äôm sure Trienen subscribes to that theory,Dodgers
"*French accent*

Ahhh the internet. What a terrible place.",Dodgers
"3.75 FIP. 4.22 xFIP.

Zone should be large and in charge,Dodgers
"He‚Äôs gonna make this game all about him, isn‚Äôt he?",Dodgers
Lol. Imagine all that money and can‚Äôt grip a ball without tack. üòÇ,Dodgers
Yeah but only because he's a douchebag,Dodgers
Anything but 13. Such a crappy number,Dodgers
8,Dodgers
25,Dodgers
In RTTS I always go 25 or 31,Dodgers
45,Dodgers

Boom Boom Boom by the Outhere Brothers,Dodgers
Was he?,Dodgers

how did you know???,Dodgers
"Weird, I was thinking that too",Dodgers
Slug aslo describes our speed on the bags.,Dodgers
Yes!!!,Dodgers

"If mookie can fix Barnes, he can fix Bauer",Dodgers
Blood from all those failed trolley dodgers,Dodgers
"it represents the blood of out enemies

jk idk",Dodgers
This is definitely not the actual answer: it has a good contrast with the white and blue,Dodgers
Red white and blue,Dodgers
Looks cool,Dodgers
Probably goes back to the Brooklyn days.,Dodgers
"History fact: the Dodgers played in the first ever televised World Series game, back in Brooklyn. In preparation for that, the team decided to wear their numbers on their front so that fans watching on TV could tell who it is. Red contrasted better on black-and-white TVs, so they made the numbers red.",Dodgers
Because: this is America,Dodgers
Cause it pops?,Dodgers
"[Different stories](https://uni-watch.com/2013/10/16/revealed-the-story-behind-the-dodgers-red-numbers/#:~:text=A%20uniform%20manufacturer%20(most%20likely,used%20on%20the%20team's%20letterhead.&text=Red%20was%20suggested%20because%20it,than%20the%20back%20blue%20numbers) but probably because it's easier to see them on TV",Dodgers

Too soon dodger bro‚Ä¶.,Dodgers
Oh shit. Just realized it‚Äôs the 7th inning‚Ä¶. Maybe not too soon‚Ä¶.,Dodgers
He‚Äôs a bloop hit machine best for a clean inning,Dodgers
Yeah what‚Äôs up with that?,Dodgers
üòÇ,Dodgers
He did wonders for developing our minor league system,Dodgers
Hes the manager for the Giants. Not that weird. Even though he was a somewhat integral part of the Dodgers org not too long ago,Dodgers
"Yes, since he‚Äôs with the Giants. Though he‚Äôs from the Valley and might‚Äôve been a Dodger fan.",Dodgers
How dare you not mention JT Snow saving Baker's kid in the world series.,Dodgers
"Just being named ""Buster Posey"" should land him in the HOF. That's a good old-timey baller name.",Dodgers
"BLA**Q** FU**Q**ING TREINEN!

It‚Äôs stupid and makes no sense.,Dodgers
"Yes, you can thank clown-Fred for that",Dodgers
"They're now confiscating, they're checking them. They're only confiscated if they're caught with the substances",Dodgers
Pretty sure they check them and give them back unless they find something,Dodgers
"Confiscate no, inspect yes",Dodgers
"Yes, they check every pitcher",Dodgers
Surely overcompensating. Took a good pitch and it causes him to be over-aggressive next pitch,Dodgers
I hope it lightly rains because rain games give extra drama,Dodgers
That's why,Dodgers
That's why!!,Dodgers
That‚Äôs why,Dodgers
truly nerve wracking when he‚Äôs in cause you never know which team he‚Äôs gonna fuck over more,Dodgers

Imagine if May was healthy. Along with rested Urias. He needs to take a start off soon.,Dodgers

yea you bet your fu**Q**ing ass they are,Dodgers
Injuries have been horrible for y‚Äôall this year. Definitely expect an uptick for you guys after the ASB. That scares me haha,Dodgers
can‚Äôt wait for seager to get back into it. it‚Äôs like he isn‚Äôt even on the team anymore,Dodgers
Seager tho üôÉ,Dodgers
At this point I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs irrational lol,Dodgers
"Lot of teams don‚Äôt like him. I‚Äôve seen him bark at lot if teams, he‚Äôs not shy. I love it",Dodgers

Jewish Space Laser is what Blake calls his fastball,Dodgers
Treinen probably would believe Greene and other kooks like her.,Dodgers
üòÇ,Dodgers
"Not /s, facts",Dodgers
My man is major league. No better in baseball.,Dodgers
No idea why he threw as many fastballs as he did tonight. His cutter should be his most used pitch. Break out the 2 seam every now and then,Dodgers
i‚Äôm excited at the prospect of this. find out all you can about the UAP‚Äôs Blake!!!!,Dodgers
"Just make sure someone reminds Joe that it's the Los Angeles Dodgers, not Brooklyn",Dodgers
I feel the same way as you.,Dodgers
"He's damn good, he just wears the wrong colors",Dodgers
So agree. First ballot HOF for sure.,Dodgers
haha for real,Dodgers
Fight on,Dodgers
He‚Äôs a giant too,Dodgers
He had a dramatic change to his stance and swing,Dodgers
All these guys are scrubs and they‚Äôre hitting like Ted Williams.  Gotta be the coaching.,Dodgers
The whole team honestly is performing .200 better than their careers. suss for sure.,Dodgers

What are you talking about?,Dodgers
"This is like asking for trouble, and I don't even hate human umps lol",Dodgers
I think we have 13 ERs on him over 6 innings... so a lot lower,Dodgers
So does he,Dodgers
"In fairness we were giving him shit for chasing low, he just over corrected.",Dodgers
right handed bat,Dodgers
">or someone that can help put the ball in play, (not just HR)

Such an overrated narrative around here. If we need help with hitting, it‚Äôs another lefty killer, and I don‚Äôt particularly care how they kill lefties as long as they kill lefties",Dodgers
"heard max scherzer was a possibility, that sounds like a godsend considering what we got rn",Dodgers
That‚Äôs how he makes his bones. I‚Äôm a cowboys fan and he hates on them so hard because we care so much about the cowboys‚Ä¶. ü§£,Dodgers
"100%, it‚Äôs pathetic that he does this shit after being given 360 million",Dodgers
No meat. Less oomph. I know vegans say you can get plenty of protein but I don't know a single vegan that isn't a twig.,Dodgers
Is that the same dad that said something about killing Angel Hernandez?,Dodgers
Joe Davis for pitching coach,Dodgers
"Ideally someone who has versatility

"Saw Paul McCartney in 2019. Best show I‚Äôve ever seen, and it was amplified by being at the greatest stadium in sports.",Dodgers

It was a RHP,Dodgers
Hes not good against righties,Dodgers
Steaming is a just weird a QR code promotion.,Dodgers
I mean it‚Äôs very hard to justify that when you have the best record in the MLB,Dodgers
Why when they can possibly give them another chance at a WS?,Dodgers
Except for those first two in the beginning,Dodgers
"Get them pregnant, Kenley",Dodgers
I think it would be single + E8,Dodgers
It‚Äôs a double if he touched and then got tagged,Dodgers
Single out trying to stretch to double,Dodgers
It'd just be a single if he's called out,Dodgers
Well... he was. Then he came off the bag and taylor kept the tag applied.,Dodgers
11 hits to 5 hits. Good win and clutch pitching but certainly not a blow out win lol,Dodgers
Seriously. fire the writers,Dodgers
"Yeah. Treinen is a stupid shit, but the comments just aren‚Äôt funny",Dodgers
Hard to imagine this being the case in late June. But you are 100% correct.,Dodgers
You have to when Angel‚Äôs calling the game,Dodgers
"I just said I‚Äôve been losing some
Confidence in him. I like him. Always have. He‚Äôs one of the reasons we won the title. But the top inning started iffy with a hit batter. He hasn‚Äôt been very good with runners on.",Dodgers

Same. I get so hyped as it goes around the stadium.  Love it.,Dodgers
"Lux, Turner, Belli - my guesses",Dodgers
Nah I ACTUALLY like that üòÇ don‚Äôt like the Giants at all,Dodgers
I have a feeling this comment is not going to age well lol,Dodgers
It's going to take some work for these teams to deny their god launch angle.,Dodgers
For Pollock it's not catchable,Dodgers
He gave away a base on a should-have-been triple yesterday too,Dodgers
2.5,Dodgers

fuck yeah four outs in the inning,Dodgers
Hard with one out,Dodgers
Like taking a long crap at 11:59 pm.,Dodgers
He's good. He's a solid 2 or 3. But we paid for a number 1.,Dodgers
Hes good,Dodgers
Good,Dodgers
Good-very good but gives up a lot of dongs. I think walker would still be my pick for a game 1 starter in the playoffs,Dodgers
Thats why you point it towards the bowl.,Dodgers

Ugh it‚Äôs not just the giants lol,Dodgers

Jon Snow Cosplayer,Dodgers
so who would you put in here.,Dodgers
Uniform counts as part of the batter.,Dodgers
NOPE,Dodgers
NOT TONIGHT,Dodgers
He doesn't fuck up on the field and he can put the hurt on a pitcher who isn't dialed in. Plus he's got the best walk-up music.,Dodgers
The Clippers don‚Äôt have bandwagon fans lol.  At least not in LA.,Dodgers

They really be like that out there tho,Dodgers

I was so shocked when I did that quest. I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ noooo‚Ä¶ maybe?‚Äù And immediately googled it lol,Dodgers

both are pretty good,Dodgers
Literally doesn't matter if they keep winning.,Dodgers

He‚Äôs given up 2 runs bro,Dodgers
If I come across it in the sub I will let you know!,Dodgers
lmao do the umps have to inspect for that too?,Dodgers
Generally nasty. Fastball is getting hammered.,Dodgers

bruh have you seen DTLA or Venice? not really the ones to talk here.,Dodgers

This is actually true. Was at the game the other day. You smell it as soon as you get off the freeway.,Dodgers
We can rivalry without being an ass. Just saying.,Dodgers

His shoulder got fucked up so he got surgery and is out for the year,Dodgers
He got hurt and is out for season,Dodgers
Edwin Rios? Season ending shoulder surgery.,Dodgers
Shoulder surgery out for the season,Dodgers
Uhhh extremely unlikely,Dodgers
Hes 3rd in runs scored,Dodgers
I was thinking the same thing‚Ä¶he has to grip the ball a lot harder now,Dodgers
??  I mean yeah it is. There‚Äôd be more this game if not for that rule lol,Dodgers
It‚Äôs amazing to watch tbh.  Excellent approach to hitting.,Dodgers
Rico Suave,Dodgers

This ain't it fam,Dodgers
Yes,Dodgers
Yes lmao,Dodgers
I‚Äôve been fully converted and I no longer feel shame about it,Dodgers
Why,Dodgers
The DH should be standard by now,Dodgers

Thanks bro.,Dodgers
Saw his IG. He does have a link to the my pillow guy lol,Dodgers
Just Muncy so far!!,Dodgers
Eh it‚Äôs an old joke but it‚Äôs a good one,Dodgers
Literally turn into Cy Young,Dodgers
I‚Äôll have to take one! I got the toy off chewy though,Dodgers
He‚Äôs lazy af smh,Dodgers
"Thanks, DM me and I‚Äôll send you a pineapple with a dildo glued to it.",Dodgers
He didn‚Äôt ur right. But he clipped his jersey,Dodgers
is he due for world series coverage and football after Joe Buck? that would be amazing!!,Dodgers
He sure did!,Dodgers
"I‚Äôll be in Reserve! That bar looks awesome, I think I can go down there now since it‚Äôs all connected.",Dodgers
Yea bit that .240 is from him mostly hitting into the ground most of the time. If he lifted the ball even a bit like he did that's gonna be more doubles with his speed,Dodgers
Eli manning jersey. Ew,Dodgers
lol yeah looks like Beyond Burgers‚Ñ¢Ô∏è are working out just fine for him,Dodgers
Agreed,Dodgers
I wonder why SNLA doesn‚Äôt hire me üòî,Dodgers

That person dipped out of the country,Dodgers
Well I‚Äôve been voting 5 times a day and I voted for him every time,Dodgers
Just let me be nervous /s,Dodgers
"LMAO. You're using FIP and xFIP on a guy/reliever with 25 innings

ERA is 2.10, I'll take results for a reliever. His BB/9 is inflated from his last 3 outings. 4BB over 1.2IP will do that.",Dodgers
He‚Äôs bb/p is at 5? That‚Äôs terrible,Dodgers
It always is when he is involved. Smh,Dodgers
He fleeced the yanks,Dodgers
"Well the guy on our mound is a douche too, I don‚Äôt care about personality tho",Dodgers
üòÇ we were one mind,Dodgers
"Here you go. 

https://youtu.be/wXKKlNoNdQY",Dodgers
Absolutely. He even got an MVP vote lol,Dodgers
Well if that's the case I hope there's no more scoring tonight.,Dodgers
Yes one ball did not hit the batter and the second batter hit himself. Nice try tho.,Dodgers
It worked out but yeah he's a good fireman for those situations,Dodgers
Now he‚Äôs doing it for the enemies‚Ä¶.,Dodgers
I did not know this. Maybe he ain‚Äôt to bad.,Dodgers
A true dodger fan would never manage the giants! I‚Äôm just sayin‚Ä¶..,Dodgers
That whole fiasco makes me wonder how TF MLB let little children who can barely walk handle bats to begin with,Dodgers
"Yeah I remember when he got called up thinking, what a stupid as hell name for a player and he ended up being good.",Dodgers
Wait I‚Äôm lost lmao. Why add the q?,Dodgers
Not surprised that bozo thought of this,Dodgers
Appreciate the clarification! I haven‚Äôt been keeping up with this new rule I just knew they implemented it,Dodgers
Seriously? Wow. The MLB is something else lol,Dodgers
Jinx!,Dodgers
"Good, be afraid",Dodgers
Just consider it practice for next year.,Dodgers
That I understand but I‚Äôm telling you their hatred transcends just being owned by him,Dodgers
I‚Äôm old,Dodgers
Hopefully Seager is that bat.,Dodgers
how about seager,Dodgers
I‚Äôd really love to see a high avg speedy righty to cash in our crazy high obp with singles,Dodgers
"lol ya, bro wtf why can't he go sub 2 against PHI, SD, and CHI??

w a s h e d.",Dodgers
Exactly!,Dodgers
"Which immediately translates into his first 44 home run season in his mid-thirties? GTFOH

He has never hit more than 21 in a season. Again, bullshit.",Dodgers
Boooo... thank you,Dodgers
[deleted],Dodgers
"Llullz.. probably true, I hope I didn‚Äôt jinx it",Dodgers
Anyone in particular?,Dodgers
"My wording may have been wrong. That would be huge. They can hit, but after recently, just looking for thoughts on potential players that could get us going, especially because of all the injuries we have delt with.",Dodgers
"Could be interesting,  he is older, but the vet presence and his attitude could bring a lot",Dodgers
He‚Äôs vegan?,Dodgers
I‚Äôve read that he‚Äôs always been a vegetarian. Just switched to vegan this off season.,Dodgers
"That‚Äôs true, I‚Äôm just thinking of what we could do at the deadline and it doesn‚Äôt feel like much outside of every team being able to use some relievers.

I figure if we need something outside of that it‚Äôs probably a righty bat.",Dodgers
"Not bad. Doesnt pump me up, but good beat. Rico Suave would be too far?",Dodgers
"I think you're right, although that ball had wicked spin",Dodgers
Oh nice I didn‚Äôt notice that!,Dodgers
They were 0-14 with RISP. A first place team would at least be 7-14 üòÖ let‚Äôs get that win tomorrow too,Dodgers
lol is there anymore?,Dodgers
"Not anymore, thanks to rhetoric like this.",Dodgers
"Lmao üòÇ these dodgers are gonna make me turn completely gay and just get into guys ü§£ Muncy, smith, Seager‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs too many",Dodgers

NL west race crazy and gives me anxiety but can‚Äôt say it hasn‚Äôt been fun. GL my dude,Dodgers
"Nah homie. Wish I could rock some dodger blue because y‚Äôall have the cleanest uniforms but always a bay fan. 

Lmao GL and I‚Äôd expect nothing less",Dodgers
The giants are asshole,Dodgers
ah I see 3.5 minus 1 is 2.5 thank you,Dodgers
Counts toward the next inning in my book,Dodgers
Well put,Dodgers
P much,Dodgers
"true, now my laptops broke",Dodgers
"yes, thank you!!",Dodgers
Trying to repeat the bellinger ordeal,Dodgers
"Alright, that‚Äôs a relief",Dodgers
Kinda my thinking too. She‚Äôs not my favorite though. I‚Äôll probably end up seeing it just to finally be back in a movie theater again lol,Dodgers
"But if he‚Äôs missing the zone like he is, that‚Äôs not good",Dodgers
That‚Äôs a secret,Dodgers
"One of the good pitchers

Like Jimmy or Treinen",Dodgers
"anyone except for the guy that has looked awful and has had big command problems in his last three appearances. this is a big two game series, why not our actual high leverage guys",Dodgers
I‚Äôm talking about twitter,Dodgers
LMAOOOO this got me,Dodgers
yes,Dodgers
"Because it gives off the impression that the fans aren‚Äôt paying attention to the game and, frankly, makes opposing fans think a lot of us are dumb baseball fans who go to games just to hangout rather than actually watch baseball. 

Similar to how the fans at the stadium get way too excited for routine fly balls because most fans in the stadium don‚Äôt seem to know baseball well enough to know that you pay attention to the outfielders to see whether a ball is well hit or not.",Dodgers
"Same, it made me laugh, I thought ‚Äúit couldnt be... It is Belli!!!‚Äù",Dodgers
"It literally *does* matter. As we all know, the postseason is different than the regular season. Other wise we'd be fucking 3 time WS champs over the past decade. They can win all they want in the Regular Season, but I think we would take them in October when the lights are the brightest.",Dodgers
"Yeah exactly, I do think they're going to be here in October either as division winners or Wild Card, but I just think they're one of those teas who exceed expectations then get exposed in October.

It ain't 2014 anymore. The magic is over.",Dodgers
No lies detected.  Even their last championship was a blooper off Mariano with the infield in.,Dodgers
Against the 2nd highest scoring team in the league in 6 innings. My God people are dumb.,Dodgers
I've seen it now. He looks good.,Dodgers
Damn spin rates haha.,Dodgers
Well even if its the Padres and not us (which i dont think) the Giants are not dominating,Dodgers
Have you been to SF recently? It's worse.,Dodgers
Yeah sorry. I forgot a few words. Am high. I edited it.,Dodgers
JFK was an inside job,Dodgers
Probably,Dodgers
He shares QAnon theories on his Instagram account üçø,Dodgers
Nice. Not a big fan of Belli's stance but that swing is beautiful.,Dodgers
"Same, he looks ready to explode",Dodgers
"Okay, maybe strikeouts?",Dodgers
It also looked like it bothered him his last ab.  He was looking at it a lot on the mound too,Dodgers
Right?,Dodgers
I‚Äôm just dunking on the Yankees bro,Dodgers
I‚Äôm shocked anyone isn‚Äôt,Dodgers
Why,Dodgers
Victor has no control and can‚Äôt get strikeouts. Cleav can get k‚Äôs at the least,Dodgers
With a fork.,Dodgers
Nothing. Time. This chat every night as something to look forward to as a distraction. Other than that nothing friend. I‚Äôm sorry and I‚Äôm sure any of us are here for you if you ever need to talk or vent or cry or anything. The people here are the best and I would still be sobbing into my pillow every day and night if I didn‚Äôt have this chat to look forward to.,Dodgers
"Lol I was kidding around but it gets toxic in here whenever we are losing, good to have you here friend",Dodgers
Hope you have a good time. Were a mostly friendly bunch,Dodgers
*smiles and laughs nervously*,Dodgers
Based,Dodgers
ohhhh tru tru,Dodgers
tru tru,Dodgers
"Yeah same here, didn‚Äôt even know there was an active sub of dodger fans who can talk amongst themselves",Dodgers
About two months,Dodgers
I thought you were newer but couldn‚Äôt tell for sure. Happy to have ya,Dodgers
"Still don't see that as a Q connection, though,  but OK",Dodgers
i know that‚Äôs what i said! i was serious lol,Dodgers
Ok now watch him go sicko mode on these boys now that they‚Äôve stepped on him,Dodgers
i‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ good thanks,Dodgers
The 1st one just made me soooooo fatigued!!,Dodgers
True but Dodgers showed a willingness to go over the tax so I'd bet they'll go over again if needed,Dodgers
Shit can you blame em,Dodgers
I don‚Äôt need nervous energy right now‚Ä¶.. üòÇ,Dodgers
Thank god.,Dodgers
Well yeah but he's a funny douche,Dodgers
this hilarious lol,Dodgers
"Totally missed the point. You're accusing hypothetical Giants fans of saying it's dirty play, just moments after you literally called the Giants cheaters for...following the rule. Uniform is considered part of the batter.

E: I don't really agree with loose clothing counting as a HBP, or clothing at all honestly. The problem is that, at some point, it gets next-to-impossible to determine whether it was clothing or human.",Dodgers
Great minds üòé,Dodgers
"Still topping the division for now! I just hope for a injury-less season for everyone going forward. Muncy and Mookie are on my fantasy team, so today isn‚Äôt all bad so far lmao",Dodgers
Literal LOL,Dodgers
Fair,Dodgers
"See: Jose Bautista, Max Muncy",Dodgers
I don‚Äôt live in Cali anymore and haven‚Äôt been to a game in a few years‚Ä¶.do you get points every time you go and get the code?,Dodgers
"My bad, I agree though, we should definitely take any additional depth we can. I‚Äôd say that depth should definitely be a righty bat.",Dodgers
Yep,Dodgers
"Honestly, I don‚Äôt think they even make a move for relievers.

Maybe they hedge their bets thinking Knebel is broken, but Knebel, Jimmy, Kenley, and Treinen is already  a death bullpen",Dodgers
Do it.,Dodgers
"To be fair the Dodgers only got one runner to scoring position all night üòÇ 3 solo shots to two solo shots was clearly a close matchup, tomorrow should be good with Walker vs. Gausman",Dodgers
Not if you ask a commie.,Dodgers
Yeah the rivalry is alive and well !,Dodgers
Some of us enjoy that too,Dodgers
thankfully not,Dodgers
Victor has a better ERA this year than both of them,Dodgers
clown.,Dodgers
The only ring they‚Äôll ever get,Dodgers
Dude that was a great hit and a great moment in sports.  Don‚Äôt care who you root for.,Dodgers
"Giants are the ones ahead of us, we‚Äôre just focused on them",Dodgers
Just because it might be worse doesn't mean LA isn't bad too lol,Dodgers
It's really the same.,Dodgers
Wow. I guess he's lost all my respect.,Dodgers
"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CQsIqwLBCKg/?utm_medium=copy_link

Angel Hernandez was really interested in that spot‚Ä¶.",Dodgers
Make love to the dh,Dodgers
Some people still enjoy baseball.,Dodgers
That means a lot fellow Internet stranger. Thank you. Hope you start feeling better as well.,Dodgers
oh lol well that‚Äôs just how a lot of dodgers fans are when the going gets tough. so far the camaraderie has been fun,Dodgers
I've been here about a month and I love it! ‚ù§,Dodgers
I comment too much üòÇüòÇ but yeah I‚Äôm newer!!,Dodgers
"Very true, Cole is just a prick",Dodgers
Muncy has hit 35 homers twice and just turned 30. WTF are you talking about?,Dodgers
"No worries.  Yeah, I love our farm system,  but we have scraped by when we called up players due to injury,  I definitely feel we could use someone that has more experience to add to our bench",Dodgers
"I agree, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if we don‚Äôt get relievers. You said all those names and still forgot our best reliever also: Phil Bickford.",Dodgers
Yes! Tomorrow will be a battle,Dodgers
lol okay McCarthy,Dodgers
üòê,Dodgers
"But less strikeouts and way more walks. 


Victor‚Äôs FIP is not what you want",Dodgers
Fair. It's pretty fucking bad here too.,Dodgers
It‚Äôs the best right??,Dodgers
Forgot Phil! But Jimmy is our best reliever for sure,Dodgers
McCarthy wasn't wrong.,Dodgers
What's wrong with liking assholes?,Dodgers
FIP doesn't invalidate ERA aka results. it supplements it.,Dodgers
Look as a bisexual I like people that like my asshole I‚Äôm just trying to shit on the giants,Dodgers
How about xERA? That‚Äôs  a whole run over his ERA. Idk what it takes to say that he‚Äôs been getting very lucky this year,Dodgers
"Lmao!! The jints are like nipple chafing? That's the worst across the board, I think.",Dodgers
